    1) You can use "name=?" option in an environment variable 
      "ROGUEOPTS".  Rogue will hear your name if you do so when you 
      begin a game.

    2) I changed it to be able to set a user name with a command-line 
      option.  From a command-line, please set a user name following a 
      "-n" option as follows.  You can use "?" to input a name later. 

        % rogue54 -n username
        % rogue54 -n ?

    3) If you push the [Ctrl]+[V] key during a game, you can save 
      options into a "rogue54.cfg" file.  It will take handling same as 
      "name=?" if you fill in a name column with "?".  It will be 
      treated with a default name if you fill in a name column with 
      "!".  When there is a "rogue54.cfg" file at the time of game 
      start, it is read automatically.  An environment variable 
      "ROGUEOPTS" is given priority to over "rogue54.cfg". 

    4) For a person except the English zone, I bundled batch file to 
      run a command-line with English mode.  Please double-click 
      "cmd_us.bat".
