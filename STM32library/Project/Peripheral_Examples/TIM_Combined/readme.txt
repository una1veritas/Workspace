@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM1 peripheral to generate 3 PWM combined 
signals with TIM1 Channel5.

TIM1 input clock (TIM1CLK) is set to APB2 clock (PCLK2)=> TIM1CLK = PCLK2 = SystemCoreClock
TIM1CLK = SystemCoreClock, Prescaler = 0, TIM1 counter clock = SystemCoreClock
SystemCoreClock is set to 72 MHz for STM32F30x devices.

The objective is to generate 3 combined PWM signal at 8.78 KHz (in center aligned mode):
    - TIM1_Period = (SystemCoreClock / (8.78*2)) - 1
 The channel 1  duty cycle is set to 50%
 The channel 2  duty cycle is set to 37.5%
 The channel 3  duty cycle is set to 25%
   
The Timer pulse is calculated as follows:
  - ChannelxPulse = DutyCycle * (TIM1_Period - 1) / 100
  
The channel 5  is used in PWM2 mode with duty cycle set to 6.22%

The 3 resulting signals are made of an AND logical combination of two reference PWMs:
  - Channel 1 and Channel 5
	- Channel 2 and Channel 5
	- Channel 3 and Channel 5

The TIM1 waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

@note The "system_stm32f30x.c" file contains the system clock configuration for
      STM32F30x devices, and is customized for use with STM32F3-Discovery Kit. 
      The STM32F30x is configured to run at 72 MHz, following the three  
      configuration below:
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSI
           - HSI (~8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system 
             clock source.  
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE          
           - HSE (8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system
             clock source.
           - The HSE crystal is not provided with the Discovery Kit, some 
             hardware modification are needed in manner to connect this crystal.
             For more details, refer to section "4.10 OSC clock" in "STM32F3 discovery kit User manual (UM1570)"
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS   
           - HSE bypassed with an external clock (fixed at 8 MHz, coming from 
             ST-Link circuit) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as 
             system clock source.
           - Some  hardware modification are needed in manner to bypass the HSE 
             with clock coming from the ST-Link circuit.
             For more details, refer to section "4.10 OSC clock" in "STM32F3 discovery kit User manual (UM1570)"
      User can select one of the three configuration in system_stm32f30x.c file
      (default configuration is PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS).           

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F3-Discovery (MB1035) 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32F3-Discovery Set-up
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms:
       - PA.08 (TIM1_CH1)
       - PA.09 (TIM2_CH2)
       - PA.10 (TIM2_CH3)
