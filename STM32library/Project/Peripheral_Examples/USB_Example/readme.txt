@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the USB-FS-Device on the STM32F30x devices.
The STM32F30x device is enumerated as an USB-FS-Device Mouse, that uses the native 
PC Host USB-FS-Device HID driver.
This example shows how the board is recognized as standard mouse and its motion will also
control the PC cursor.
The LSM303DLHC MEMS accelerometer device mounted on the STM32F3-Discovery board
is used to emulate the Mouse directions.

@note The "system_stm32f30x.c" file contains the system clock configuration for
      STM32F30x devices, and is customized for use with STM32F3-Discovery Kit. 
      The STM32F30x is configured to run at 72 MHz, following the three  
      configuration below:
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSI
           - HSI (~8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system 
             clock source.  
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE          
           - HSE (8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system
             clock source.
           - The HSE crystal is not provided with the Discovery Kit, some 
             hardware modification are needed in manner to connect this crystal.
             For more details, refer to section "4.10 OSC clock" in "STM32F3 discovery kit User manual (UM1570)"
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS   
           - HSE bypassed with an external clock (fixed at 8 MHz, coming from 
             ST-Link circuit) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as 
             system clock source.
           - Some  hardware modification are needed in manner to bypass the HSE 
             with clock coming from the ST-Link circuit.
             For more details, refer to section "4.10 OSC clock" in "STM32F3 discovery kit User manual (UM1570)"
      User can select one of the three configuration in system_stm32f30x.c file
      (default configuration is PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS).           

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F3-Discovery (MB1035) 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32F3-Discovery Set-up
    - Connect an USB cable to the user USB connector.
