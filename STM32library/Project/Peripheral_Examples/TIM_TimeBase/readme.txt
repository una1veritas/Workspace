@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral in Output Compare Timing 
mode with the corresponding Interrupt requests for each channel in order to generate
4 different time bases.

The TIM3CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock (Hz), to get TIM3 counter 
clock at 6 MHz so the Prescaler is computed as following:
   - Prescaler = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 72MHz.

The TIM3 CC1 register value is equal to 40961, 
CC1 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR1_Val = 1757.77 Hz,
so the TIM3 Channel 1 generates an interrupt each 6.8ms

The TIM3 CC2 register is equal to 27309, 
CC2 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR2_Val = 2636.49 Hz
so the TIM3 Channel 2 generates an interrupt each 4.55ms

The TIM3 CC3 register is equal to 13654, 
CC3 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR3_Val = 5273.18 Hz
so the TIM3 Channel 3 generates an interrupt each 2.27ms

The TIM3 CC4 register is equal to 6826, 
CC4 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR4_Val =  10547.9 Hz
so the TIM3 Channel 4 generates an interrupt each 1.13ms.

When the counter value reaches the Output compare registers values, the Output 
Compare interrupts are generated and, in the handler routine, 4 leds (LED3, LED4, 
LED5 and LED6) are toggled with the following frequencies: 

- LED3: 878.88 Hz (CC1)
- LED4: 1318.24Hz (CC2)
- LED5: 2636.59Hz (CC3) 
- LED6: 5273.95Hz (CC4)

@note The "system_stm32f30x.c" file contains the system clock configuration for
      STM32F30x devices, and is customized for use with STM32F3-Discovery Kit. 
      The STM32F30x is configured to run at 72 MHz, following the three  
      configuration below:
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSI
           - HSI (~8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system 
             clock source.  
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE          
           - HSE (8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system
             clock source.
           - The HSE crystal is not provided with the Discovery Kit, some 
             hardware modification are needed in manner to connect this crystal.
             For more details, refer to section "4.10 OSC clock" in "STM32F3 discovery kit User manual (UM1570)"
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS   
           - HSE bypassed with an external clock (fixed at 8 MHz, coming from 
             ST-Link circuit) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as 
             system clock source.
           - Some  hardware modification are needed in manner to bypass the HSE 
             with clock coming from the ST-Link circuit.
             For more details, refer to section "4.10 OSC clock" in "STM32F3 discovery kit User manual (UM1570)"
      User can select one of the three configuration in system_stm32f30x.c file
      (default configuration is PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS).           

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F3-Discovery (MB1035) 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32F3-Discovery Set-up
    - Use LED3, LED4, LED5 and LED6 connected respectively to PE.09, PE.08,PE.10 
    and PE.15 pins and connect them on an oscilloscope to show the different 
    Time Base signals.
