Read this before submitting patches:

    http://leaflabs.com/docs/libmaple/contributing.html

In particular, patches without sign-off lines will not be accepted.

If your patch is formatted very differently from the libmaple style,
you may find the astyle options file in contrib/astylerc useful for
auto-formatting it roughly in the libmaple style.

LeafLabs is a small shop.  Please help us merge your patches
efficiently by getting formatting nits etc. out of the way before
submitting.

When writing your patch, feel free to add yourself to the CREDITS
file.  If you can't write your name in ASCII (or choose not to
romanize it), then use UTF-8, and use your best judgement for how it
should sort compared to the other names in the file.
