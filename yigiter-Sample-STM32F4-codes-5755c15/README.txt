Sample I2C and SDIO codes for STM32F4 discovery board.
Despite the names say "lib", actually they are not library functions.

SDIOLIB: An example project describing how to read/write binary data to the SD cards using SDIO interface with the DMA
I2C: An example project showing I2C communication with 1,2 >=3 bytes without using the DMA.
