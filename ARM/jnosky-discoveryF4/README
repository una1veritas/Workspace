Purpose:

A general repository for projects tailored to run on the STM32F4 Discovery board.
The example code can be compiled from Linux or Windows using

https://github.com/esden/summon-arm-toolchain

Debugging and flashing can be provided with:

https://github.com/texane

The examples will be linked to the STM provided libraries, and make files are provided to
 build these libraries using the above mentioned tools.

I personally use eclipse and will be leaving the .cproject and .project files in the repo
 for those who would like to "import existing projects" into eclipse.
Eventually these project files will be supporting source code debug using the texane
 gdbserver application mentioned above.
