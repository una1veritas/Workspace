  - Software environemnt
  ----------------------
    This Demo runs with

     - EWARM from version 6.21
     - MDK-ARM 4.21 
     - TrueSTUDIO V2.1.0.

  - ST-LINK/V2 driver requirement
  ------------------------------
    - After installing EWARM 6.21, you should install the ST-LINK/V2 driver by 
      running the ST-Link_V2_USB.exe from
      [IAR_INSTALL_DIRECTORY]\Embedded Workbench 6.0_2\arm\drivers\ST-Link
      \ST-Link_V2_USBdriver.exe
    - For MDK-ARM and TrueSTUDIO the ST-LINK/V2 driver is installed automatically 

  - ST-LINK/V2 driver requirement
  ------------------------------
    - After installing EWARM 6.21, you should install the ST-LINK/V2 driver by 
      running the ST-Link_V2_USB.exe from
      [IAR_INSTALL_DIRECTORY]\Embedded Workbench 6.0_2\arm\drivers\ST-Link
      \ST-Link_V2_USBdriver.exe
        
  - Hardware environemnt
  ----------------------
     - Check jumper position on the board, JP1 on, CN3 on (Discovery selected).
     - Connect the STM32L-Discovery board to a PC with a USB cable to power the board.

@par Example Description 

This demonstration firmware aims to demonstrate temperature sensor capabilities embedded in STM32L microcontroller

When powered up, the temperature sensor application example first displays a welcome 
message before immediately displaying the current temperature in degrees Celsius with a 2-
second refresh rate. When the User button is pressed once, the display shows the mean 
value from the samples acquired by the ADC. One more press of the User button toggles 
between displaying the current temperature in degrees Celsius or the averaged value 
calculated from samples acquired by the ADC.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
1- Run the ST-Link_V2_USBdriver.exe (detailed in "ST-LINK/V2 driver requirement" 
   section above)
2- Open STM32L-Discovery project
3- Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
4- Run the example
