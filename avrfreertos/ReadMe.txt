You must use Arduino 1.5.2to run FreeRTOS on the Arduino Due. 

A patch is included for 1.5.1 but it is no longer supported.

The documentation for FreeRTOS is located here:

http://www.freertos.org/

FreeRTOS is version 7.3.0

These libraries were tested with Arduino 1.03 for AVR boards, Arduino 1.5.2
for Due and beta12 version of the Teensy 3.0 software.

To install these libraries and run the FreeRTOS examples, copy the
included libraries to your libraries folder.

The version of SdFat is optimized for Arduino Due and Teensy 3.0.

Please read FreeRTOS.html for more information.
