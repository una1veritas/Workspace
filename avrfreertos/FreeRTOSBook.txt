The folder examples/FreeRTOSBook has sixteen examples.

These examples are described in the book: 

Using The FreeRTOS Real Time Kernel - a Practical Guide 

http://shop.freertos.org/RTOS_primer_books_and_manual_s/1819.htm

The following examples are fully described in the above book.  I have modified
The examples to run as Arduino sketches.  The original code is here.

Warning: The interrupt examples use attachInterrupt() to generate interrupts.
         The pin for interrupt zero must be free for use as an output on AVR.

         On ARM Due you must connect pin 2 to pin 3.

Input characters will stop an example.
