Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; 
that your word is your bond and you do what you say you're going to do; 
that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them. 
And Barack and I set out to build lives guided by these values, and pass them on to the next generation. 
Because we want our children - and all children in this nation - to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.
