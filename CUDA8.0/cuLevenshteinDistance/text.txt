That you work hard for what you want in life;
that your words is your bond and you do what you say you're going to do;
that you treat people with dignity and respect, 
even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them. 
Because we want our children, and all children in this nation, 
to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.
