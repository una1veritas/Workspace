From a young age, my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise, that you treat people with respect. 
They taught and showed me values and morals in their daily lives. 
That is a lesson that I continue to pass along to our son. 
And we need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow. 
Because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.
