<b>NAME</b>
       yaze-ag - yet another z80 emulator by ag

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>yaze</b>  [<b>-1</b>]  [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-b</b>bootfile] [<b>-l</b>loadadr] [<b>-p</b>basepage] [<b>-s</b>startup]
       [<b>-z</b>Z3ENV] command...
       <b>cpm ...</b>
       <b>z80 ...</b>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>yaze-ag</b> is designed to provide an exact simulation of  the
       Z80  microprocessor  on a Unix system.  In addition to the
       instruction-set emulator, a CP/M basic i/o system is  pro&minus;
       vided  that  can reference Unix directories and Unix files
       containing images of CP/M  disks.   When	 a  genuine  CP/M
       operating  system (ccp + bdos) or a clone system is loaded
       into the emulator, a complete CP/M  system  is  available,
       running on a Unix host.

       <b>yaze-ag-2.10</b> is a further development of yaze-1.10. New in
       yaze-ag is the emulated Memory Management Unit  (MMU)  and
       the  BIOS which supports CP/M 3.1 or ZPM3 which is used in
       yaze-ag. You can still run CP/M 2.2 or  SuperDos	 (a  CP/M
       2.2 replacement) in yaze-ag if you want.

       <b>yaze</b>  is	 a shell script. It is used to start yaze-ag.  It
       tests firstly if the startup file .yazerc is in the direc&minus;
       tory of `pwd`.  If there is one it starts at once <b>yaze_bin</b>
       the binary of the Z80 emulator.
       If no .yazerc exists it tests if the  directory	$HOME/cpm
       exists.	If  not it creates $HOME/cpm. Then it copies some
       yaze-disks into $HOME/cpm which are necessary for  running
       yaze-ag	with CP/M 3.1 respectively ZPM3.  Then it creates
       $HOME/cpm/doc and sets links in that directory to the com&minus;
       plete  documentation.   This  will  be  done  only  if  no
       $HOME/cpm directory exists.
       At last it changes to $HOME/cpm and starts <b>yaze_bin</b>.  This
       will  be	 done every time you starts the shell script yaze
       and if there is no .yazerc in the `pwd`.

       yaze-ag can also be started with <b>z80</b>  or	 <b>cpm</b>.	They  are
       links to the shell script yaze.

       The  complete  documentation  is	 contained  in	the  file
       yaze.doc and the new features  of  yaze-ag-2.01  describes
       the file yaze-ag.doc (see $HOME/cpm/doc).

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-1</b>     set  sector  size	 to 128 bytes for all disks (only
	      CP/M 3.1).

	      If you create a disk file under the yaze-ag monitor
	      or  with the cdm(1) utility and you use the default
	      sectors per track (see create) the sektor	 size  is
	      also set to 2048 bytes (only CP/M 3.1).

	      If  you use software like a disk edit utility under
	      CP/M 3.1 it can be necessary to set the sektor size
	      to 128 bytes.

	      See  also the monitor command 128 above in the sec&minus;
	      tion MONITOR COMMANDS.

       <b>-v</b>     causes a summary of the system configuration to  be
	      displayed after loading.

       <b>-b</b>     gives the name of a file to be loaded into the emu&minus;
	      lated  processor's  ram  before  the  emulation  is
	      started.	 The  file is loaded at the address given
	      by the -l option, if one is present, or else at the
	      basepage	(see -p).  If a bootfile is not specified
	      with the -b option,  yaze-ag  looks  for	the  file
	      yaze-cpm3.boot in the current directory first, then
	      in /usr/local/lib/yaze to boot CP/M 3.1.	If  yaze&minus;
	      ag  is  compiled without the flag -DBOOTSYS yaze-ag
	      looks for the  file  yaze.boot  (instead	of  yaze&minus;
	      cpm3.boot)  to boot the CP/M 2.2 replacement Super&minus;
	      Dos.

       <b>-l</b>     the hexadecimal address at which to load and  start
	      the bootstrap file, if a separate bootstrap is nec&minus;
	      essary.

	      If you want to run CP/M 2.2 while yaze-ag	 is  com&minus;
	      piled  to	 load  yaze-cpm3.boot  (CP/M 3.1) you can
	      start yaze-ag with the options

	      <b>yaze -l -1 -b yaze.boot</b>

       <b>-p</b>     the top 2 hex digits of the location  of	the  CP/M
	      console  command	processor  (CP/M  2.2).	 Also the
	      location to which bootfile is loaded if a -l option
	      is not present.

       <b>-s</b>     a	 file  containing monitor commands that are to be
	      executed before starting the emulator.   If  no  -s
	      option  is present, .yazerc from the current direc&minus;
	      tory or from the user's home directory is taken.

       <b>-z</b>     the hexadecimal address in the emulated processor's
	      ram  of  a  1KByte area that should be reserved for
	      use by an extended CP/M clone such as ZCPR3.

<b>MONITOR COMMANDS</b>
       When the emulator is started it	executes  commands  first
       from  the  startup file, then from the tail of the command
       line (any strings which follow the options) and then  from
       the  tty	 if neither the startup file nor the command line
       included a "go" command.	 Control can be returned  to  the
       monitor	by executing the CP/M sys.com command or, if yaze
       was compiled with -DDEBUG, by sending it a SIGINT  signal.

       Command	names  can be shortened to a unique abbreviation.
       If <b>yaze-ag</b> was compiled with  GNU  Readline,  command-line
       editing, filename completion and history recall are avail&minus;
       able - see the readline documentation.

       The monitor commands are described in more detail  in  the
       file   yaze.doc.	  The	command	 '128'	is  described  in
       yaze-ag.doc.

       <b>help</b>   Display a command list

       <b>help</b> cmd
	      Give details about cmd

       <b>attach</b> Attach CP/M device to a Unix file

       <b>detach</b> Detach CP/M device from file
       
       <b>setaccess</b>
       	      Turns on/off access time stamps for mounted directories

       <b>mount</b>  Mount a Unix file or directory as a CP/M disk
       
       <b>remount</b>
	      Remount a CP/M disk

       <b>umount</b> Unmount a CP/M disk

       <b>create</b> Create a new disk

       <b>128</b>    Set sektor size to 128 for  all  disks  (only  CP/M
	      3.1).   To  reverse this option you have to restart
	      yaze-ag.

       <b>interrupt</b>
	      Set user interrupt key

       <b>go</b>     Start/Continue CP/M execution

       <b>!</b>      Execute a Unix command
