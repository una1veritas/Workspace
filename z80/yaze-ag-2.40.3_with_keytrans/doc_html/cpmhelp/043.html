  Syntax:

              DESTINATION              SOURCE

    PIP d:{Gn} | filespec{[Gn]} = filespec{[o]},... | d:{[o]}

  Explanation:

  The file copy program  PIP  copies  files,  combines  files,  and
  transfers  files  between  disks,  printers,  consoles,  or other
  devices attached to your computer.  The  first  filespec  is  the
  destination. The  second filespec is the source.  Use two or more
  source filespecs separated by commas to combine two or more files
  into  one file.  [o] is any combination of the available options.
  The [Gn] option in the destination filespec  tells  PIP  to  copy
  your file to that user number.

  PIP with no command tail displays an *  prompt  and  awaits  your
  series  of  commands,  entered  and processed one line at a time.
  The source or destination can be any CP/M 3 logical device.
