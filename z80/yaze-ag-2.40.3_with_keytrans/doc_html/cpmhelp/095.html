	I made some optimizing in simz80.c.
	The Z80 interpreter yaze-ag-2.01 is faster than of the
	version yaze-1.10

	Also I made a lot of changes in simz80.c for usage the MMU.

	**********************************************************************
	* BUT I MADE THE CHANGES VERY CAREFULLY AND I DOES NO CHANGES IN THE *
	* ALGORITHM OF ANY CODE INTERPRETATION. ANY INSTRUCTION WORKS VERY   *
	* WELL - ZEXALL.COM/ZEXDOC.COM SAY OK TO ALL INSTRUCTIONS. :-)       *
