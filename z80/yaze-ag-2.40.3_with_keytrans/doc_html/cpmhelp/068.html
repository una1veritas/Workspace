  Syntax:

          SETDEF { d: {,d: {,d: {,d:}}}} {[ TEMPORARY = d: ] |
                                          [ ORDER = (typ {,typ}) ]}
          SETDEF [DISPLAY | NO DISPLAY]

          SETDEF [PAGE | NOPAGE]

          SETDEF [US | UK | YMD]

  Explanation:

  SETDEF allows the user to display or define  up  to  four  drives
  for  the program search order, the drive for temporary files, and
  the file type search order.   The   SETDEF   definitions   affect
  only   the   loading   of programs  and/or  execution  of  SUBMIT
  (SUB) files.  SETDEF turns on/off the system Display and  Console
  Page  modes. When   on, the system displays the location and name
  of programs loaded or SUBmit  files  executed,  and  stops  after
  displaying one full console screen of information. SETDEF is also
  used  to  select  whether  dates  are  displayed  in  US,  UK  or 
  Year-Month-Day format.
