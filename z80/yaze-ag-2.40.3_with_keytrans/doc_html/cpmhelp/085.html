  All the  CP/M 3  patches  described in the  document  CPM3FIX.PAT 
  have  been  applied to the source code,  except those relating to 
  INITDIR. Patches applied were nos. 1-18, except nos. 5 and 9.

  CP/M 3  is  now  fully  Year  2000  compliant.  This  affects the 
  programs DATE.COM, DIR.COM and SHOW.COM.

  Dates can be displayed in US,  UK or Year-Month-Day format.  This 
  is set by SETDEF.

  The CCP has a further bug fix: A command sequence such as:

  C1
  :C2
  :C3

  will now not execute the command C3 if the command C1 failed.
