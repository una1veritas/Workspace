       A>SAVE

  Activates the SAVE utility.  Now enter the name  of  the  program
  which loads a file into memory.

       A>SID dump.com

  Next, execute the program.

       #g0

  When the program exits, SAVE intercepts the return to the  system
  and prompts the user for the filespec and the bounds of memory to
  be SAVEd.

       SAVE Ver 3.0
       Enter file (type RETURN to exit):dump2.com

  If file DUMP2.COM exists already, the system asks:

       Delete dump2.com? Y

  Then the system asks for the bounds of memory to be saved:

       Beginning hex address: 100
       Ending hex address: 400

  The contents of memory from 100H (Hexadecimal) to 400H is  copied
  to file DUMP2.COM.
