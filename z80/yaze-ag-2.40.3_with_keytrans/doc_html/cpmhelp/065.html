  [CREATE=ON]    turns on CREATE time stamps on  the  disk  in  the
                 default   or   specified   drive.  To  record  the
                 creation time of a file, the CREATE option must be
                 turned on before the file is created.

  [ACCESS=ON]    turns on ACCESS time stamps on  the  disk  in  the
                 default  or  specified  drive.  ACCESS  and CREATE
                 options are mutually exclusive; only one can be in
                 effect  at a time.  If you turn on the ACCESS time
                 stamp on  a  disk  that   previously   had  CREATE
                 time     stamp,   the   CREATE   time   stamp   is
                 automatically turned off.

  [UPDATE=ON]    turns on UPDATE time stamps on  the  disk  in  the
                 default  or  specified  drive.  UPDATE time stamps
                 record the time the file was last modified.
