  ECHO      specifies that input is echoed to  the  console.   This
            is the default option.

  NO ECHO   specifies that  file   input   is  not  echoed  to  the
            console.  The program output and the system prompts are
            not affected by this option and are still   echoed   to
            the console.

  SYSTEM    specifies that all  system  input  is immediately taken
            from  the disk file specified in the command line.  GET
            takes system and program input from the file until  the
            file  is  exhausted  or  until  GET reads a GET console
            command from the file.
