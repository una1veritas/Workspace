  A>LINK b:MYFILE[NR]

       LINK-80 on drive A uses as input MYFILE.REL on drive B   and
       produces   the  executable  machine  code file MYFILE.COM on
       drive B.  The [NR] option specifies no symbol table file.

  A>LINK m1,m2,m3

       LINK-80 combines the separately compiled files m1,  m2,  and
       m3,  resolves  their  external  references, and produces the
       executable machine code file m1.COM.

  A>LINK m=m1,m2,m3

       LINK-80 combines the separately compiled files m1,  m2,  and
       m3 and produces the executable machine code file m.COM.

  A>LINK MYFILE,FILE5[s]

       The [s] option tells LINK-80 to search FILE5 as a   library.
       LINK-80    combines    MYFILE.REL    with   the   referenced
       subroutines contained in FILE5.REL  on  the  default   drive
       A  and  produces MYFILE.COM on drive A.
