  Syntax:

      PUT CONSOLE {OUTPUT TO} FILE filespec {option} | CONSOLE
      PUT PRINTER {OUTPUT TO} FILE filespec {option} | PRINTER
      PUT CONSOLE {OUTPUT TO} CONSOLE
      PUT PRINTER {OUTPUT TO} PRINTER

  Explanation:

  PUT puts console or printer  output  to  a  file  for   the  next
  command  entered at the console,  until  the  program terminates.
  Then  console  output  reverts  to the console.  Printer   output
  is   directed   to   a   file   until   the   program terminates.
  Then printer output is put back to the printer.

  PUT  with  the    SYSTEM    option   directs   all     subsequent
  console/printer   output  to  the  specified  file.  This  option
  terminates when you  enter  the  PUT  CONSOLE  or   PUT   PRINTER
  command.
