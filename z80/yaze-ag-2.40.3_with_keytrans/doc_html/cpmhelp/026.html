  Syntax:

  GET {CONSOLE INPUT FROM} FILE filespec{[{ECHO|NO ECHO} | SYSTEM]}
  GET {CONSOLE INPUT FROM} CONSOLE

  Explanation:

  GET  directs the system to take console input from a file for the
  next system  command  or  user  program entered at the console.

  Console input  is  taken  from   a   file   until   the   program
  terminates.  If  the  file  is  exhausted before program input is
  terminated, the program  looks  for  subsequent  input  from  the
  console.  If  the  program  terminates  before exhausting all its
  input, the system reverts back to the console for console  input.

  With  the  SYSTEM  option,  the  system  immediately  goes to the
  specified file for console input.  The  system  reverts  to   the
  console   for  input  when it reaches the end of file.  Re-direct
  the system to the  console  for   console   input  with  the  GET
  CONSOLE INPUT FROM CONSOLE command as a command line in the input
  file.
