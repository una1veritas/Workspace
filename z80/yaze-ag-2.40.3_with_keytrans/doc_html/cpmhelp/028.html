  A>GET FILE XINPUT
  A>MYPROG

       Tells the system to  activate the GET utility.  Since SYSTEM
       is  not specified, the system reads the next input line from
       the console and   executes   MYPROG.    If  MYPROG   program
       requires  console  input,  it is taken from the file XINPUT.
       When MYPROG terminates,  the  system  reverts  back  to  the
       console for console input.

  A>GET FILE XIN2 [SYSTEM]

       Immediately  directs   the   system    to    get  subsequent
       console  input from file XIN2 because it includes the SYSTEM
       option.  The system reverts  back   to   the   console   for
       console  input  when it reaches the end of file in XIN2.  Or
       XIN2 may redirect the system  back  to  the  console  if  it
       contains a  GET CONSOLE command.

  A>GET CONSOLE

       Tells the system to get console   input  from  the  console.
       This  command may be used in a file (previously specified in
       a GET FILE command), which is already  being  read   by  the
       system   for   console  input.  It is used  to re-direct the
       console input back to  the console  before the   end-of-file
       is reached.
