<b>Yet Another Z80 Emulator by AG (yaze-ag-2.30.2)
===============================================</b>

yaze-ag-2.30.2.tar.gz is the final release of version 2.30 with the extension
to run also under the cygwin environment under windows.

yaze-ag-2.30.2 runs under:	Solaris (Sparc)
				Linux
				FreeBSD
				Cygwin (Windows) (since V2.30.2 also for 64Bit)
				MacOS-X

yaze-ag-2.30.2 is a further development of yaze-1.10.

How you install is described in INSTALL-2.30 !!!


<b>What is YAZE-AG?</b>

YAZE-AG is an excellent Z80 emulator, written in ANSI C, that works on many
Unix architectures like Solaris, OSF, FreeBSD, Linux, Mac-OS-X and the cygwin
environment (Windows). It is fast, emulates undocumented opcodes, and passes
instruction regression tests against real Z80 hardware.

| NEW in version 2 is the emulated Memory Management Unit (MMU) and the BIOS
| which supports CP/M 3.1 (or ZPM3 of Simeon Cran which is used in yaze-ag).

Yaze-ag-2.30.2 is a final release and I am thinking this version runs quite
stable. All known bugs are solved which are described under "Fixed Bugs" in
yaze-ag.doc (or yaze-ag_doc.html).

There are new features (against version 1.10) which are described under
"FEATURES" in yaze-ag.doc too.

"Mounting directories" in yaze-ag.doc describes the special feature to import
directories into the emulator by connecting them to CP/M drives. That way
you can easily import files into the emulator.

With the utilities W.COM and R.COM you can export and import files inside the
emulator. This feature is added sice version 2.30.

The other way to export/import files out/into the emulator is the "cdm"
utility (CP/M disk manager) (see man page cdm.1 or cdm(1)).


If you find an error or you miss a feature so feel free and send an email
to me.

Look also to INSTALL-2.30.2, yaze.doc, yaze-ag.doc, the README's, yaze.1 (man
yaze) and cdm.1 (man cdm).
