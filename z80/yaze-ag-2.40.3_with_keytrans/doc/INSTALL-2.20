Install yaze-ag-2.20:
=====================

Sections:

	1. SOLARIS 8 (Sparc)
	2. LINUX
	3. FreeBSD
	4. Cygwin (Windows)
	5. MacOS-X (not yet ready)


1. If you want to run yaze-ag under SOLARIS 8 (Sparc) then
   (gcc 3.x.x)

	copy  Makefile_solaris  to  Makefile

	edit Makefile in the section optimizing: Refer the
	switches -mcpu and -mtune in "man gcc" and set the switches
	like your hardware (default: none)

	then call "make"

	If you want to install the emulator in the system read the
	notes above in this document.
	To install the files in /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib/yaze
	give the command "make install" as root.


2. If you want to run yaze-ag unter LINUX then
   (gcc version 3.3 20030226 (prerelease) (SuSE Linux))

	copy Makefile_linux  to Makefile

	edit Makefile in the section optimizing:
	Refer the section optimizing (gcc 2.x.x and gcc 3.x.x) and
	set -mcpu like your hardware (default: -march=pentium3)

	then call "make".

	If you want to install the emulator in the system read the
	notes above in this document.
	To install the files in /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib/yaze
	give the command "make install" as root.


3. If you want to run yaze-ag under FreeBSD then

	copy  Makefile_freebsd  to  Makefile

	edit Makefile in the section optimizing:
	Refer the section optimizing (gcc 2.x.x and gcc 3.x.x) and
	set -mcpu like your hardware (default: -march=pentium3)

	then call "make".

	If you want to install the emulator in the system read the
	notes above in this document.
	To install the files in /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib/yaze
	give the command "make install" as root.


4. If you want to run yaze-ag under Cygwin (Windows) then
   (gcc version 3.3.2 (cygwing special))

	copy  Makefile_cygwin  to  Makefile

	edit Makefile in the section optimizing:
	Refer the section optimizing (gcc 2.x.x and gcc 3.x.x) and
	set -mcpu like your hardware (default: -march=pentium3)

	then call "make".

	If you want to install the emulator in the system read the
	notes above in this document.
	To install the files in /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib/yaze
	give the command "make install".


4. If you want to run yaze-ag under Mac-OS then
   (gcc ?.?.?)

	You have to use the Makefile_solaris

	Refer to section "Solaris"

	Which switches are to set, that I don't know at this time.



Notes if you want to install yaze-ag in your system
===================================================

"make install" do following:  (BINDIR, LIBDIR ... are defined in the Makefiles)

    in BINDIR
	install yaze_bin	(yaze-ag executable (the Z80 emulator))
	install cdm		(CP/M Disk Manager)
	install yaze		(a shell script which copies some CP/M disks
				 if necessary and starts yaze_bin, see yaze(1))
	symbolic link  cpm --> yaze
	symbolic link  z80 --> yaze

    in LIBDIR
	install yaze-cpm3.boot	(bootsys + cpm3.sys) (ZPM3)
	install yaze.boot	(Superdos a CP/M 2.2 replacement)

    in MANDIR
	install yaze.1		(man page of yaze-ag)
	install cdm.1		(man page of the CP/M Disk Manager)
	install cpm.1		(reference to yaze.1)
	install z80.1		(reference to yaze.1)

    in DSKDIR
	Install some disks which are copied by the shell script "yaze"
	to $HOME/cpm if necessary (have a look to yaze(1) ).

    in DOCDIR
	install the whole documentation there. The shell script "yaze"
	makes links to this documents in $HOME/cpm/doc.

    in DOCHTMLDIR
	install the whole documentation there in HTML format. The shell
	script "yaze" makes links to this documents in $HOME/cpm/doc_html.



How do you start yaze-ag?
=========================

Start YAZE-AG-2.20 with the shell script "yaze". Look to yaze.1 or
yaze(1) (man yaze) it describes also the strategy of the script yaze.

If you does no changes in the Makefile yaze-ag (yaze_bin) will be compiled
with the options -DMMU and -DBOOTSYS. So yaze-ag will load and run
yaze-cpm3.boot at 0100H (BOOTSYS.com+CPM3.SYS) instead of yaze.boot (CP/M 2.2).
If the option -DBOOTSYS is deleted yaze-ag starts CP/M 2.2 (yaze.boot) - then
you can start CP/M 3.1 by simple running cpm3.com (the unix file yaze-cpm3.boot
is the same as cpm3.com).

If you delete the option -DMMU yaze-ag can run only CP/M 2.2 (yaze.boot) then
you have to delete -DBOOTSYS too.

Dokumentation
=============

Look to 00-INDEX.doc it describes the several document files!

The whole dokumentation are in yaze-ag.doc, yaze.doc and the README's,

Yaze-ag.doc and README_BOOTSYS describes my new CP/M 3.1 Bootloader BOOTSYS and
describes why I had to developed BOOTSYS and how BOOTSYS works.

README_BIOS3_Z80 describes the Z80 ASM-files of the CP/M 3.1 BIOS on drive P:
which act as an interface to the yaze-bios (bios.c).

On every yaze-disk is a file with the name "0-README.1ST". This file describes
the contents of the disk.

Let me know if you test yaze-ag-2.20 or if you find an error or you miss a
feature. Feel free and send an email to me.
