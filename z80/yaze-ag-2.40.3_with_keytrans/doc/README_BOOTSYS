What is BOOTSYS?
================

The BOOTSYS utility relocates and places the resident and banked (if present)
part in CPM3.SYS to their right places into memory and starts CP/M 3.1.

Here is a part of the source of bootsys.z80:

        title   'BOOTSYS - CPM3.SYS 1.00'
        subttl  Copyright (C) 2000 Andreas Gerlich
        page    70,132

        ; BOOTSYS WILL NOT WORK ON ALL CP/M 3.1 SYSTEMS. WHY ?
        ; If the MOVE, XMOVE are placed in the banked part of the bios
        ; then it can be that this parts will be superscribed when
        ; bootsys+cpm3.sys are transfered to bank 0.
        ; Try it if this utility works under your CP/M 3 system.
        ; If it works you can start a new version of your
        ; bios (if you develop one) direct under CP/M 3.1 .
        ;
        ; Bootsys works always under CP/M 2.2 to relocate a nonbanked or a
        ; banked system in CPM3.SYS and start CP/M 3.1 !!!
        ;
        ; You generate a cpm3.com for starting CP/M 3.1 with:
        ;       pip cpm3.com=bootsys.com,cpm3.sys
        ;


What does BOOTSYS:
==================

	1. It tests if it runs on a x86 machine.
	   (If it detect a x86 processor it execute x86-code which prints a
	    message what BOOTSYS is and print the WWW and the FTP addresses
	    of yaze-ag and exits.)
	    
	2. Check if CP/M vectors are present at 0000H (wboot) and 0005H (bdos).
	   (- If present all output go direct to the conout of the bios. So
	      this utility works also under other CP/M 3.1 systems as YAZE-AG.
	      (Try it, I want to know if bootsys works on your cp/m-system.)
	    - If not, bootsys try to boot CPM3.SYS in cooperation with YAZE-AG.)

	3. Test if a copyright message is in the joined CPM3.SYS.
	   (If not a message will be printed and bootsys exits.)

	4. Test if CP/M 2.2 or CP/M 3.1 is running (only if cp/m vectors are
           present):
		CP/M 2.2 --> boot CPM3.SYS at once.
		CP/M 3.1 --> transfere all from bank 1 to bank 0
			     switch to bank 0 and boot CPM3.SYS.
			     (If your Bios does not support xmove bootsys
			      prints a message and exits.)

	5. Relocate CPM3.SYS   (look to bootsys.z80 on drive P: how I
				do it, sorry but the comments are in
				german language ;-))

	6. Start CP/M 3.1 by jumping into the boot routine of the bios.


How do you use BOOTSYS?
=======================

You generate a CPM3.COM for starting CP/M 3.1 with the following command:

	PIP CPM3.COM=BOOTSYS.COM,CPM3.SYS

You simple append CPM3.SYS to BOOTSYS.COM.


Usefull information are also in INSTALL-2.01, yaze-ag.doc, yaze.doc and
README_BIOS3_Z80 (describe the files of the CP/M 3.1 bios (see drive P:) which
acts as an interface to the yaze-bios (bios.c) ) !
