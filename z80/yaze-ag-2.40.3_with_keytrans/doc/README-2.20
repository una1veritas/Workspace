What is YAZE-AG?

YAZE-AG is an excellent Z80 emulator, written in ANSI C, that works on many
Unix architectures like Solaris, OSF, FreeBSD, Linux, Mac-OS-X and the cygwin
environment (Windows). It is fast, emulates undocumented opcodes, and passes
instruction regression tests against real Z80 hardware.

| NEW in version 2 is the emulated Memory Management Unit (MMU) and the BIOS
| which supports CP/M 3.1 (or ZPM3 of Simeon Cran which is used in yaze-ag).

Yaze-ag-2.20 is a final release and I am thinking this version runs quite
stable. All known bugs are solved which are described under "Fixed Bugs" in
yaze-ag.doc (or yaze-ag_doc.html).

There are new features (against version 1.10) which are described under
"FEATURES" in yaze-ag.doc too.

"Mounting directories" in yaze-ag.doc describes the special feature to import
directories into the emulator by connecting them to CP/M drives. That way
you can easily import files into the emulator.

The other way to export/import files out/into the emulator is the "cdm"
utility (CP/M disk manager) (see man page cdm.1 or cdm(1)).


If you find an error or you miss a feature so feel free and send an email
to me.
