History of updates to CMSISv2p00_LPC13xx
========================================

28 April 2011
-------------
Updated with new LPC13xx.h (dated 2011-04-28). Some registers
have been renamed, though originals have been left in place
via the use of unions. It is recommended that code is ported
to use the new names...

In LPC_SYSCON_TypeDef...
... SSPCLKDIV => SSP0CLKDIV

In LPC_IOCON_TypeDef...
... JTAG_TCK_PIO0_10 => SWCLK_PIO0_10
... JTAG_TDI_PIO0_11 => R_PIO0_11
... JTAG_TMS_PIO1_0 => R_PIO1_0
... JTAG_TDO_PIO1_1 => R_PIO1_1
... JTAG_nTRST_PIO1_2 => R_PIO1_2
... ARM_SWDIO_PIO1_3 => SWDIO_PIO1_3 
... SCK_LOC => SCKLOC 

In LPC_ADC_TypeDef...
... DR0,DR1...DR7 => DR[8] 

In IRQn_Type...
... SSP_IRQn => SSP0_IRQn

In APB0 peripherals #define's...
... LPC_SSP_BASE => LPC_SSP0_BASE

Other minor changes to LPC13xx.h due to changes in LPC1300L
parts. Also added power_api.h for use by LPC1300L parts.
