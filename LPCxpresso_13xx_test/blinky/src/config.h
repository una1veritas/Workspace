/*
Overview:
   This example shows how to use a timer to blink an LED. It works by using
   libLPC to configure a I/O port and a 32-bit timer, then setting up a timer
   interrupt to increment a counter. The main loop polls the counter to
   determine when to toggle the LED state.

User #defines:
   LED_PORT	I/O port driving an LED
   LED_BIT  I/O port bit driving an LED
   LED_ON   Value to set the bit to turn on the LED
   LED_OFF  Value to set the bit to turn off the LED
   LED_TOGGLE_TICKS
		    Number of timer ticks per flash. The timer is configured to generate
		    an interrupt 100 times a second or every 10mS.

How to use:
   Click the debug toolbar button.

   * You should see an LED flashing.

#define LED_PORT 0		// Port for led
#define LED_BIT 7		// Bit on port for led
#define LED_ON 1		// Level to set port to turn on led
#define LED_OFF 0		// Level to set port to turn off led
#define LED_TOGGLE_TICKS 100 // 100 ticks = 1 Hz flash rate
