systick
======================
This project contains a LED flashing Systick example for the LPCXpresso
board mounted with an LPC1343 Cortex-M3 part.

When downloaded to the board and executed, LED2 will be illuminated.
The state of LED2 will toggle every 2 seconds, timed using the Cortex-M3's
built in Systick timer. Note: The Cortex systick timer will not operate in
sleep mode, however the 16 and 32-bit timer peripherals will.

The project makes use of code from the following library project:
- CMSISv1p30_LPC13xx : for CMSIS 1.30 files relevant to LPC13xx

This library project must exist in the same workspace in order
for the project to successfully build.
