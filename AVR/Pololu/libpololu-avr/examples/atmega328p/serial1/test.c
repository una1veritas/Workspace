/*  
 * serial1: for the Orangutan controllers and 3pi robot.
 *
 * This example listens for bytes on PD0/RXD.  Whenever it receives a byte, it
 * performs a custom action.  Whenever the user presses the middle button, it
 * transmits a greeting on PD1/TXD.
 *
 * The Baby Orangutan does not have a green LED, LCD, or pushbuttons so
 * that part of the code will not work.
 *
 * To make this example compile for the Orangutan SVP, you
 * must add a first argument of UART0 to all the serial_*
 * function calls.
