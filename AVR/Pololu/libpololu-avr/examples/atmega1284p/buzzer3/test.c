/*
 * buzzer3: for the Orangutan LV/SV-xx8
 *
 * This example program is indended for use on the Orangutan LV/SV-xx8.
 * It uses the OrangutanBuzzer functions to play a series of notes on
 * the Orangutan's buzzer.  It uses the OrangutanPushbuttons
 * functions to allow the user select which melody plays.
 *
 * This example demonstrates the use of the play_mode()
 * and play_check() methods, which allow you to select
 * whether the melody sequence initiated by play() is
 * played automatically in the background by the Timer1 interrupt, or if
 * the play is driven by the play_check() method in your main loop.
 *
 * Automatic play mode should be used if your code has a lot of delays
 * and is not time critical.  In this example, automatic mode is used
 * to allow the melody to keep playing while we blink the red user LED.
 *
 * Play-check mode should be used during parts of your code that are
 * time critical.  In automatic mode, the Timer1 interrupt is very slow
 * when it loads the next note, and this can delay the execution of your.
 * Using play-check mode allows you to control when the next note is
 * loaded so that it doesn't occur in the middle of some time-sensitive
 * measurement.  In our example we use play-check mode to keep the melody
 * going while performing timing measurements using Timer2.  After the
 * measurements, the maximum time measured is displayed on the LCD.
 *
 * Immediately below are three #define statements that allow you to alter
 * the way this program runs.  You should have one of the three lines
 * uncommented while commenting out the other two:  
 *
 * If only WORKING_CORRECTLY is uncommented, the program should run in its
 * ideal state, using automatic play mode during the LED-blinking phase
 * and using play-check mode during the timing phase.  The maximum recorded
 * time should be 20, as expected.
 *
 * If only ALWAYS_AUTOMATIC is uncommented, the program will use automatic
 * play mode during both the LED-blinking phase and the timing phase.  Here
 * you will see the effect this has on the time measurements (instead of 20,
 * you should see a maximum reading of around 27 or 28).
 *
 * If only ALWAYS_CHECK is uncommented, the program will be in play-check
 * mode during both the LED-blinking phase and the timing phase.  Here you
 * will see the effect that the LED-blinking delays have on play-check
 * mode (the sequence will be very choppy while the LED is blinking, but
 * sound normal during the timing phase).  The maximum timing reading should
 * be 20, as expected.
