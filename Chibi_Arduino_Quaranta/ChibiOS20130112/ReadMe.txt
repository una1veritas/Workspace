You must install a patch to run ChibiOS on the Arduino Due. Follow the 
instructions in the DuePatch folder's ReadMe.txt file.

Warning: If this is your first use of a RTOS, you will likely experience the
pain of my bugs and problems that are inherent to preemptive RTOSs.  Please
read the warnings in the included html documentation.
