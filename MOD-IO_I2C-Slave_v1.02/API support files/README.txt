	*** OLIMEX support source files for MOD-IO ***

1. Description
	These support files provide a software I2C bus interface to connect to a MOD-IO board. Any two port pins may be used as the SCL and SDA lines respectively, there is the only need to replace defines at the top of the MOD_IO.c file.

	These files were used and tested with the PIC18 series, maybe they need minor modifications to implement them in other PIC series or other MCUs. Hope you'll find them useful in some way.
