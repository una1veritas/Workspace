Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng rejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losing orders to South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, a spokesman for the Taiwan Textile Federation said.  He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile associations last Saturday the government could not fix the Taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency.  The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold the exchange rate at that level.  The federation said in its request that many local textile exporters were operating without profit and would go out of business if the rate continued to fall.  Reuter &#3;

Italy's state-owned &lt;Banca Nazionale del Lavoro - BNL> said it would issue 120 mln dlrs of five-year convertible eurobonds, an operation to be lead-managed by &lt;Credit Suisse-First Boston Ltd>.  BNL president Nerio Nesi told a news conference that the issue, to be placed on the main international markets and listed in Luxembourg, would be the first equity linked issue by an Italian bank on the Euromarket.

Transform Logic Corp said it has revised downward its previously reported fourth quarter and year, ended October 31, results to reflect compensation expense for employee stock options.  The company said resolution of this disagreement with its auditors came as a result of Securities and Exchange Commission involvement.

Unilever Plc &lt;UN.A> and NV group reported improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling prices, disposals and currency movements, Unilever Plc chairman Michael Angus said.  He told reporters that volumes in North America increased some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct after being flat for some years.  Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he noted.  But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic acquisitions taking place "from time to time," he said.  The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously. In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level dropped three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion.  Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc &lt;CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any earnings dilution.  However, it would not add much to profits, with much of the company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs.  Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing - debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986 from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about 40 pct by end-1987.  The same divergence was made in full year dividend, with Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with the change in attributable profit.  Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he said that there was no target date for completing the process.  He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to realise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which operates outside Unilever's core activities.  In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business, considerable expansion in the household products business and in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.  However, he noted that the U.S. Household products business had turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performance better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs of its Surf detergents.

The loan is convertible into an additional 229,463 DIM shares, it noted.  The proposed agreement is subject to approval by the French government, it said.  Reuter &#3;

Holiday said by the end of the year, there will be approximately 220 Holiday Inn hotels in 54 countries.  The company said it plans to expand from 28 to 55 hotels in its Asia/Pacific region and to 192 in its Europe/Middle East/Africa regionby 1995.  For 1987, the hotel group will focus on expansion on Western Europe and Asia, citing China as an untapped source for the international lodging industry.  Holiday also said it will concentrate on city center hotels in key destination cities in Western Europe, catering primarily to business travelers.  Some of those cities where Holiday said it will open new properties this year include Amsterdam, Lyon/Atlas and Lisbon.  Reuter &#3;
China called on the United States to remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.  But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports.  The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.  "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports," the editorial said.  "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).  "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries," it added.  The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said that "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.  He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.  Reuter &#3;
Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said after the release of a sharply lower January leading indicator index that a pickup in exports is needed.  "The best tonic for the economy now would be a pickup in net exports," he said in a statement after the department reported the index fell 1.0 pct in January from December, the sharpest drop since a 1.7 pct fall in July, 1984.  The main reasons for the January decline after a 2.3 pct December rise were declines in building permits, new orders for plant and equipment and for consumer and industrial goods.  Reuter &#3;
&lt;Precambrian Shield Resources Ltd>, earlier reporting a large loss against year-ago profit, said the 1986 loss was mainly due to a 51,187,000 dlr writedown on its U.S. operations, uneconomic coal and other mineral properties.  Precambrian, which is 89 pct owned by &lt;Mark Resources Inc>, said it took the writedown in accordance with new Canadian Insititute of Chartered Accountants guidelines for full cost method accounting by oil and gas companies.  Precambrian earlier reported a 1986 loss of 53.4 mln dlrs, compared to profit of 4.5 mln dlrs in the prior year.  Reuter &#3;

The Kenyan economy is heading for difficult times after a boom last year, and the country must tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging too far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said.  In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi said high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth of five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985.  The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in 1985, he added.  "But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a result, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange reserves during the year," he said.  The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreign exchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986.  Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a barrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs.  Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline in the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more difficult to finance the government's budget deficit.  Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of capital for the first time in its history, he added.  "This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult phase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative that we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign sources to finance our development," he said.  "It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more frugal in satisfying immediate needs," the president added.  REUTER &#3;

The department revised downward December's sales to a 12.1 pct rise to 768,000 units from the previously reported 12.7 pct increase.  The January decline in sales was the largest since last October when sales fell 9.3 pct.  Before seasonal adjustment, the number of homes actually sold in January was 53,000, up from 49,000 in December but down from 59,000 in January, 1986.  The January fall brought home sales to a level 1.6 pct below January, 1986, when they were a seasonally adjusted 728,000 units.

Eastman Kodak Co said it is introducing four information technology systems that will be led by today's highest-capacity system for data storage and retrieval.  The company said information management products will be the focus of a multi-mln dlr business-to-business communications campaign under the threme "The New Vision of Kodak."  Noting that it is well-known as a photographic company, Kodak said its information technology sales exceeded four billion dlrs in 1986. "If the Kodak divisions generating those sales were independent, that company would rank among the top 100 of the Fortune 500," it pointed out.  The objective of Kodak's "new vision" communications campaign, it added, is to inform others of the company's commitment to the business and industrial sector.  Kodak said the campaign will focus in part on the information management systems unveilded today --  -- The Kodak optical disk system 6800 which can store more than a terabyte of information (a tillion bytes).  - The Kodak KIMS system 5000, a networked information management system using optical disks or microfilm or both.  -- The Kodak KIMS system 3000, an optical-disk-based system that allows users to integrate optical disks into their current information management systems.  -- The Kodak KIMS system 4500, a microfilm-based, computer-assisted system which can be a starter system.  Kodak said the optical disy system 6800 is a write-once/ready-many-times type its Mass Memory Division will market on a limited basis later this year and in quantity in 1988.  Each system 6800 automated disk library can accommodate up to 150, 14-inch optical disks. Each disk provides 6.8 gigabytes of randomly accessible on-line storage. Thus, Kodak pointed out, 150 disks render the more-than-a-terabyte capacity.  Kodak said it will begin deliveries of the KIMS system 5000 in mid-1987. The open-ended and media-independent system allows users to incorporate existing and emerging technologies, including erasable optical disks, high-density magnetic media, fiber optics and even artificial intelligence, is expected to sell in the 700,000 dlr range.  Initially this system will come in a 12-inch optical disk version which provides data storage and retrieval through a disk library with a capacity of up to 121 disks, each storing 2.6 gigabytes.  Kodak said the KIMS system 3000 is the baseline member of the family of KIMS systems. Using one or two 12-inch manually loaded optical disk drives, it will sell for about 150,000 dlrs with deliveries beginning in mid-year.  The company said the system 3000 is fulling compatibal with the more powerful KIMS system 5000.  It said the KIMS system 4500 uses the same hardware and software as the system 5000. It will be available in mid-1987 and sell in the 150,000 dlr range.  Reuter &#3;
Bangor Hydro-Electric Cor said it has filed with the Maine Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) for a two-stage base rate reduction.  Bangor Hydro said the first stage, which could take effect on April 1 and would stay effective until the MPUC makes a final decision on the filing, could cut revenues by 6.149 mln dlrs, or 9.7 pct.  The company said lower federal income taxes and lower capital costs prompted the filing.  The second stage, Bangor Hydro said, effective when the MPUC makes a final decision, calls for an additional revenue reduction of 712,000 dlrs, or 1.1 pct.  Bangor Hydro said, if approved, the cuts would reduce residential base rates by 8.5 pct, with 7.5 pct cut by April 1.  The utility company also said it is seeking to increase its fuel cost adjustment rate by April 1.  Bangor said if the increase is approved it could offset much of the base rate cut and may cause a net increase in some customers' rates.  Reuter &#3;

Saxon Oil Development Partners' Saxon Oil Co said its chairman Bill Saxon and chief executive officer Steven Saxon have resigned effective immediately.

Pharmacia AB &lt;PHAB ST> forecast earnings after financial items of one billion crowns in 1987 vs 821.2 mln last year on condition that exchange rates remained at their present parities.  Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986, it said.  A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed on currency movements.  Last year's results were also badly hit by a once-off writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets.  The company said mainly this represented the premium the group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it had taken over.  The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87 billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln.  Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it having used more funds than generated by group operations, mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares in LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular Inc.

Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire said modified legislation to help a federal deposit insurance fund and prohibit new limited-service banks and thrifts could be ready for a Senate vote in two to three weeks.  Proxmire said he agreed to demands from committee members for a one-year moratorium on granting new business powers sought by commercial banks to increase the bill's chances.  In its new form, the bill would proscribe regulators from granting new powers to banks, Proxmire told reporters after a speech to the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.  A vote on the bill by the committee is scheduled for Thursday. If approved it will go to the full Senate.  "I have spoken to the majority leader and he has agreed to bring it up promptly on the Senate floor in two or three weeks," Proxmire told the thrift executives.  The bill would recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp fund with 7.5 billion dlrs.  It also would prohibit establishment of new nonbank banks and nonthrift thrifts, so-called because they provide financial services but do not meet the regulatory definition of both making loans and receiving deposits.

The U.K. Exported 535,460 tonnes of wheat and 336,750 tonnes of barley in January, the Home Grown Cereals Authority (HGCA) said, quoting adjusted Customs and Excise figures.  Based on the previous January figures issued on February 9, wheat exports increased by nearly 64,000 tonnes and barley by about 7,000 tonnes.  The new figures bring cumulative wheat exports for the period July 1/February 13 to 2.99 mln tonnes, and barley to 2.96 mln compared with 1.25 and 1.89 mln tonnes respectively a year ago.  January wheat exports comprised 251,000 tonnes to European Community destinations and 284,000 tonnes to third countries.  The Soviet Union was prominent in third country destinations, taking 167,700 tonnes while Poland was credited with 54,500 and South Korea 50,000 tonnes. Italy was the largest EC recipient with 75,000 tonnes followed by West Germany with 55,200 and France 52,000 tonnes.

Canada's real gross domestic product, seasonally adjusted, rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, the same as the growth as in the previous quarter, Statistics Canada said.  That left growth for the full year at 3.1 pct, which is down from 1985's four pct increase.  The rise was also slightly below the 3.3 pct growth rate Finance Minister Michael Wilson predicted for 1986 in February's budget. He also forecast GDP would rise 2.8 pct in 1987.  Statistics Canada said final domestic demand rose 0.6 pct in the final three months of the year after a 1.0 pct gain in the third quarter.  Business investment in plant and equipment rose 0.8 pct in the fourth quarter, partly reversing the cumulative drop of 5.8 pct in the two previous quarters.  Reuter &#3;

Western USSR winter wheat areas have had only light and spotty snow and winterkill is possible tonight and tomorrow night as temperatures drop to minus 10 to 0 degrees F.  Snow cover is scant in Poland, with only about 50 pct of the winter wheat areas reporting one to two inches of snow as of this morning.  The remaining 50 pct of winter wheat crops do not have snow cover, making winterkill possible on each of the next two nights. Lowest temperatures will be minus 10 to 0 degrees F.  Winter wheat areas from eastern Czechoslovakia through northern Romania had light snow flurries yesterday and last night, but amounts were an inch or less. With temperatures expected to fall to near 0 degrees F over the next two nights, some light winterkill is possible, Accu-Weather added.  Reuter &#3;

U.S. Carmaker General Motors hopes to sell between 7,000 and 8,000 vehicles in Europe this year, a five-fold rise over the year before, James Fry, vice-president of GM Overseas Distribution Corporation told a news briefing.  "The low dollar makes our prices very attractive," he said at a GM preview before the opening of the Geneva Motor Show.  "We would like to sell between 7,000 and 8,000 units in Europe for the year to August 1987," he told Reuters later. Officials said GM sold 1,500 vehicles in the 1986 model year.  Fry said that at an average price of 13,000 dlrs, his projected sales figures would mean turnover of between 91 mln and 104 mln dlrs in Europe.  GM sales in Europe in the 1985 model year totalled 500 vehicles, due largely to uncompetitive prices because of the then strong dollar, Fry said.  All GM vehicles sold in Europe are manufactured in the United States and Canada, he said, adding that most sales were in Switzerland followed by Sweden and West Germany.  Reuter &#3;

The collapse of International Coffee Organization, ICO, talks on export quotas yesterday removes the immediate need to reinstate U.S. legislation allowing the customs service to monitor coffee imports, analysts here said.  The Reagan administration proposed in trade legislation offered Congress last month that authority to monitor coffee imports be resumed. That authority lapsed in September 1986. A bill also was introduced by Rep. Frank Guarini (D-N.J.).  However, the failure of the ICO talks in London to reach agreement on export quotas means the U.S. legislation is not immediately needed, one analyst said. Earlier supporters of the coffee bill hoped it could be passed by Congress quickly.  "You're going to have a hard time convincing Congress (now) this is an urgent issue," the coffee analyst said.

Former Treasury official C. Fred Bergsten said a new exchange rate system is needed to replace the fixed and flexible exchange rate systems which he said had not worked.  "I prefer a move to 'target zones' in which the major countries would determine ranges of 15-20 pct within which they would pledge to hold their exchange rates by direct intervention and, as necessary, by changes in monetary and other policies," Bergsten, now the director of the Institute for International Economics, said in a statement to a House Banking subcommittee.  "The substantial correction of the exchange rate that has occurred since early 1985 is enormously welcome, and should produce a sizeable reduction in the U.S. trade deficit this year and next, but the imbalance will not fall much below 100 billion dlrs on present policies, so much more is needed," he said.

Syria has complained to the United Nations that Israeli occupation authorities were blocking the export of citrus fruit from the Gaza Strip to the countries of the European Community, EC.  In a letter to Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, published here today, Syrian U.N. charge d'affaires Abdul Mou'men Al-Atassi said: "These measures threaten to create a slump in citrus production, which constitutes the primary source of income in the Gaza Strip....They are causing heavy losses to farmers and all those working in the field of citrus production and threaten to bring about economic disaster."  The Syrian envoy said the Israel action was a violation of the Geneva Conventions, the U.N. Charter and the "legitimacy of the economic rights endorsed by the United Nations."  The Gaza Strip, occupied by Egypt in the 1948 Arab-Israel war, was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.  Reuter &#3;
There was no evidence of winterkill in Yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a line running northwest from Belgrade to near Maribor, the U.S. Agriculture Department's counselor in Belgrade said in a field report.  The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of delayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall because of dry conditions.  However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on last fall's late seeding, it said.  Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the report said.  Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damage under these conditions, they said.  The report said all wheat farmers contacted during the field trip were optimistic about the crop and the way it emerged from winter.  Reuter &#3;

Additional payments may be made annually through the year ending March 31, 1991 to bring the total consideration up to 9.5 pct of Cleveland's average post-tax profits in the last two years of the period.

Continental Corp said the fresh start provision of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 may add 1.30 to 1.60 to 1987 earnings per share.  The insurance holding company had net earnings of 449.6 mln dlrs, or, or 7.42 per share, in 1986.  John Loynes, Continental chief financial officer, said the fresh start provision allowed the company to discount opening tax reserves to January 1, 1987, which released deferred taxes into earnings.  Loynes said the provision's potential benefit would decline gradually over the next four years, during which time Continental will pay 250 mln to 350 mln dlrs more in taxes.  Loynes added, however, the higher taxes are not expecetd to have a significant impact on earnings.  Reuter &#3;

Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman De Croo said he believed there would be a compromise within the European Community, EC, on its proposed tax on vegetable fats and oil, averting a pledged tough trade response by the United States.  De Croo, in Washington for talks with Administration officials and Congressional leaders, said at a news conference there is a battle within the community on the tax on fats and oils used in the 12 EC countries.  But he added, "I do not think it will be a big issue because there will be a big debate inside Europe," adding "so there will be a compromise."  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday that if the community went ahead with the tax, the United States would respond "vigorously" to protect its trade rights and access to community markets.  De Croo also said he thought the community would postpone its April 28 deadline for imposing new slaughterhouse rules to cover all meats brought into EC nations if some progress was made toward resolving differences with the United States.  U.S. officials say its rules now meet health standards and the EC should require equivalent but not identical standards.  He also told reporters he hoped the community could deal with another controversial health proposal that would forbid the feeding of hormones to cattle, which is also opposed by the United States.  De Croo gave no deals on how he though the issue might be resolved. That rule is go into effect on January 1, 1988.  He said U.S. cattlemen say there is no reason to change slaughterhouse practices in April if the meat is to be banned a few months later by the hormone rule.  Reuter &#3;

House Banking committee chairman Fernand St Germain, D-R.I., called for caution in giving savings associations forbearance in paying their debts as part of a bill providing three billion dlrs in new capital for the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.  "We cannot let forbearance stretch to protect the mismanaged or terminal cases that would serve to further drain the FSLIC fund," St Germain said at the start of a hearing on FSLIC legislation.

The upcoming five-month deficiency payments to corn and sorghum farmers will be made half in cash and half in generic commodity certificates, a senior Agriculture Department official told Reuters.  Around 300 mln dlrs of the in-kind certificates, or "certs," will be mailed out to farmers around March 15 or 16, Tom von Garlem, Assistant Deputy Administrator for USDA's state and county operations, said.  The decision to make the payments in a 50/50 cash/certs ratio was made Monday, but payments to producers will be delayed until mid-month due to a problem with USDA's computer program, von Garlem said. get 11.5 cts per bushel in this next payment -- 5.75 cts in certs and around 5.5 cts cash (5.75 cts minus Gramm-Rudman).  Farmers who did not receive advance deficiency payments at signup will receive 63 cts per bushel. Slightly more than half of this payment will be in cash, von Garlem said, but he said this will not markedly upset the 50/50 ratio, since most farmers got advance payments.  "The final certificate payments will be very close to 300 mln dlrs," he said.  When asked if the Office of Management and Budget had resisted the cash/certs ratio, the USDA official said that "we proposed 50/50 and OMB accepted it."  Reuter &#3;
Ford Motor Co of Canada Ltd, 90 pct owned by Ford Motor Co &lt;F>, said the earlier reported decline in full year net profit was mainly due to changeoover costs at its Essex, Ontario engine plant.  Ford Canada also said sharply improved fourth quarter results were due to improved cost recovery and lower product program costs, partially offset by lower engine production.  The company earlier said consolidated 1986 net income fell to 101.9 mln dlrs from year-ago 199.0 mln dlrs. Fourth quarter profit improved to 67.7 mln dlrs from 4.5 mln dlrs in the prior year.  Ford Canada said full-year earnings from its Canadian operations declined 75.4 mln dlrs to 104.0, while fourth quarter profit increased to 49.1 mln dlrs from 16.1 mln dlrs in the prior year.  Ford Canada reported a full year loss of 2.9 mln dlrs from its overseas operations, compared to a 19.6 mln dlr profit in 1985. Fourth quarter earnings from overseas operations rose to 18.6 mln dlrs from a loss of 11.6 mln dlrs in the prior year.  The company reported full-year domestic sales in Canada of 4.35 billion dlrs compared to 3.95 billion dlrs in 1985, excluding export sales to its U.S. parent.  Ford Canada said it had 1986 export sales to its parent company of 7.97 billion dlrs, up from year-earlier 7.18 billion dlrs.  The company reported 1986 overseas sales fell 205.7 mln dlrs to 2.01 billion dlrs from 2.21 billion dlrs in 1985.  The company attributed the improvement in fourth quarter results from overseas operations to manufacturing efficiencies, cost reduction programs and improved cost recovery, which were partially offset by lower industry volumes.  Ford Canada's net loss for the year from overseas operations resulted from lower industry volumes and increased interest costs, the company said.  Despite increased competition, Ford Canada's market share of car sales rose to 17.2 pct from 17.0 pct in 1985, it said. The company's share of industry truck sales rose to 29.7 pct in 1986 from year-earlier 29.2 pct.  Ford Canada said sales were boosted by its Ford Tempo car and Ford light truck, both manufactured in Oakville, which were Canada's best selling car and truck nameplates in 1986.  Reuter &#3;
Firestone Tire and Rubber Co has notified the United Rubber Workers the company will close its Des Moines, Iowa, Bloomington, Ill., and Oklahoma City tire plants on or before September 15.  A Firestone spokesman said the cost of the closings will be covered by the 65 mln dlrs restructuring charge the company took in the fourth quarter of 1986.  The company said it was notified by the union March one that the agreement reached with Local 998 at the Oklahoma City tire plant had been rejected by union members at the other plants.  Firestone said it has been discussing the possible sale of its Des Moines and Bloomington plants with prospective buyers for several months.  Those discussions are continuing, the company said, adding it could not predict their outcome. Firestone is willing to work with any organization wishing to consider the purchase of the three tire plants, it added.  Last October, Firestone advised the union the tire plants in Des Moines, Bloomington and Oklahoma City were being designated as "distressed" under the terms of its master agreement with the rubber workers.  Firestone said it has twice reached agreement with the leadership and members of the local in Oklahoma City on plans to reduce operating costs through revisions in wages, benefits and work rules.  Union procedures, however, require approval by the Firestone section of the union's International Policy Committee, membrs of other locals covered by the master contract and by the rubber workers' executive board.  The company said the rejection of the Oklahoma City package by union locals at Des Moines and other locations and the limited sales and profit opportunities for agricultural and off-the-road tires in North America led Firestone to conclude the parties would be unable to reach agreements that would permit the continued operation of the Des Moines and Bloomington plants.

Venezuela will limit new loans to 50 pct of the interest and principal it repays on its 31 billion dlr foreign debt, President Jaime Lusinchi told political leaders.  Speaking last night at a new session of congress, he said last week's agreement to reschedule 21 billion dlrs in public sector foreign debt at lower interest rates reflected Venezuela's improved credit image.  "Our priority is development, but I insist that there cannot be development if we don't fulfil our obligations," he said.  Venezuela agreed last Friday with its 13-bank advisory committee to lower the interest margin to 7/8 pct over libor from 1-1/8 and reduce amortisations in the next three years to 1.35 billion dlrs from 3.35 billion.  "The important thing is that this rate of 7/8 pct is a marker for new negotiations and will save us 50 mln dlrs this year," Lusinchi said.  He said the country had been loyal to the principles of the Cartagena group of Latin American debtors but had "decided to reach an agreement convinced that Venezuela is a specal case, because of the vulnerability of its economy."  Venezuela signed a 12-1/2 year rescheduling accord in February, 1986, but immediately sought new terms because of falling oil income, which dropped 40 pct last year.  Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua told reporters he hopes to sign the new rescheduling accord early in the second quarter, but that in any case it would become effective from April 1.  Azpurua said Venezuela's 450 or so creditor banks have been contacted with details of the new agreement, and that Public Finances Director Jorge Marcano may visit financial centres to round up support.  Azpurua said that among the details still to be finalised were the exact timetable for reprogrammed payments and the outlines of a government plan to allow public and private sector debt capitalisation.  He said banks had shown willingness to consider new loans to Venezuela, a fundamental achievement in the new accord.  "Substantial progress has been made in talks and we will now have to define more precisely what projects can be financed from foreign borrowing," he said, adding that loans for steel and aluminium and iron ore sectors could be the first to materialise.

Royal Bank said it set its provisions "given the continued debt-servicing problems ... in the North American energy industry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices," and also continued to add to its general provisions for loans to troubled borrower countries.  The bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter ended January 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in the year-ago quarter.  The bank said non-accrual loans, net of provisions for loan losses, totalled 2.2 billion dlrs on January 31, up from 2.0 billion dlrs a year ago.  In reporting lower first quarter earnings, chairman Allan Taylor said problems with credit quality--particularly in loans associated with the energy sector--continue to have a substantial adverse effect on the bank's earnings.  Taylor said profitability of the bank's international operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities.  Taylor said it would be premature to speculate on the outcome of debt resturcturing negotiations with Brazil or their potential impact on the Royal Bank.

BBL, Belgium's second largest commercial bank, had failed to win shareholder approval for the move last month because of a lack of quorum. No quorum was required today.

Nigeria and Guinea agreed to set up a new company with Liberia to carry out the 14-year-old Mifergui-Nimba iron ore project, an official communique said.  The communique was issued after two days of talks here between Guinean natural resources minister Ousmane Sylla and Nigerian minister of mines and power Bunu Sheriff Musa.  Originally, Guinea held 50 pct in the project and Nigeria 16.2 pct with firms from several other countries also involved, but the project ran into problems over funding and the slump in world iron ore markets.  Musa said Liberia was invited to join and its share will be decided after a project feasibility study. This would be completed in May after which finance will be sought. Officials said the study will be undertaken with the help of the World Bank, which is also expected to give financial support.  Production, originally estimated at 15 mln tonnes a year, will be 12 mln initially and is expected to begin in early 1990.  On an agreement between the two countries to prospect for uranium in Guinea, the communique said Musa and Sylla agreed that because of poor market conditions, it would be extended to cover exploration for gold, diamonds, cobalt, nickel and silver.

A World Bank team led by senior economist Katrine Saito arrived in Uganda for talks on an economic recovery program projected to cost one billion dlrs over three years.  The four-member mission is expected to stay two to three weeks. An International Monetary Fund (IMF) team is due here over the same period, a World Bank offical said.  The World Bank last year criticised Uganda's policies on deficit financing and exchange and interest rates, issues likely to dominate talks on the government's proposed recovery program.  Finance Minister Chrispus Kiyonga said last month that most of the one billion dlrs would go towards rehabilitating industries, repairing and maintaining roads and buying tractors and other agricultural needs.  He did not say where the money would come from, but diplomats expect the government to ask the World Bank and other foreign donors to provide most of the foreign exchange portion.  REUTER &#3;

The London Stock Exchange's traded options market plans volume growth of at least 80 pct a year, and will more than double the range of options available by the end of 1988, options committee chairman Geoffrey Chamberlain said.  He told a news conference that more options contracts were traded in 1986 than in the previous seven years of the market's existence.  Chamberlain said the daily average volume of contracts traded in February this year almost tripled to 53,056 from 19,034 in the same month last year, and further rapid growth was expected.  "We're aiming for 100 stock option classes by the end of 1988," said Chamberlain. These would correspond to the eligible constituents of the FT-SE 100 share index.  Chamberlain added that two new equity options were to be introduced this month. Options will be available in Sears Plc &lt;SEHL.L> from March 4, and in Plessey Co. Plc &lt;PLYL.L> from March 19.  The London Stock Exchange is the largest outside the United States for options trading. Forty-five equity options, two currency options, two government bond (gilt) options and an option on the FTSE-100 index are available at present.  Chamberlain said the Stock Exchange aimed to consolidate the London options market's leading position in Europe, especially important with French and Swiss equity options trading planned to start this year.  "I'd go so far as to say the plans for growth are conservative," one leading options analyst said, predicting continuing volume growth of around 20 pct a month for at least the next year.  He said much of the recent growth in options had come from inter-market-maker trading aimed at hedging book positions. But now the retail options market was beginning to take off.  The market trades from a corner of the now largely deserted floor of the London Stock Exchange. The floor has been left almost empty in the wake of the recent regulatory changes in the equity and gilts (government bond) markets, which have encouraged a move to electronic off-floor trading.  Yesterday, the Stock Exchange decided to close the floor to equities trading altogether, and said it expected to make a final decision on the floor's future by the end of 1987.  The floor space could be used for a purpose-built options market, but Chamberlain said that it was unlikely that the options market would need more than half of the available space.  REUTER &#3;

&lt;Royal Bank of Canada>, in reporting a 19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects to report improved results in future earnings periods.  "Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income, highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the periods ahead," chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement.  The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year ago.  Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's international operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities.  The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103 mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs from 42 mln dlrs last year.  Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues from international investment banking as well as a significant loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago.  Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but lower securities commissions from international investment bank operations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said.  The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to 98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages.  Reuter &#3;

Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman De Croo said if Congress passed legislation curbing world textile imports the only way the European Community (EC) could react was to retaliate.  De Croo said at a news conference "if you limit textile imports, you will re-orient textiles to Europe."  And that he said would trigger EC taxes on U.S. goods.  Congress passed a textile bill two years ago, but it was vetoed by President Reagan on grounds that curbing imports to protect the domestic textile industry would trigger retaliation U.S. trading partners.  A similar bill has been introducted this year, in a Congress with a bigger Democratic majority and with a President weakened by the Iran scandal.  De Croo, here for talks with Administration officials and Congressmen, said if a textile bill passed, "the only way we could react would be retaliation, and it would cause more retaliation, which is not a good way to deal with problems."  He said if a textile bill was enacted, "we will impose taxes on a lot of American products." He said "it would be stupid. We have to avoid that."  He said Congressmen seem upset mosty with Japan, because of its massive trade suprlus with the United States, and not with EC nations, but EC nations will be hurt by the diverted shipments of Asian textiles.  De Croo also criticized the way U.S. officials try to solve EC trade issues, saying "each time we come in contact, it a conflict contact. The clouts are coming fom the West."  He said it then is a crisis atmosphere with officials cross the Atlantic and dramatized with headlines.  "This is not the way to work in a serious way between two big powers," De Croo said.   reuter &#3;

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptation to pass a protectionist trade bill this year.  In remarks prepared for delivery before the National Press Club, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., predicted major trade legislation will be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year.  But he warned that his "conciliatory message" on the trade bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn other countries their access to the American market would be curtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods.  "Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not a smoke screen for protectionism, they a plea for fairness," Rostenkowski said.  "It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the American market," he added.  However, he said there would likely be changes in the market access proposal from the plan which cleared the House last year. That plan would have set a specific time table for foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face a 25 pct cut in exports to the United States.  Reuter &#3;

Anacomp Inc, one of the most actively traded NYSE issues, rose today as at least one analyst expected earnings to be boosted by its planned acquisition of a micrographics company.  Anacomp rose 1/2 to 6-3/4 on volume of 950,000 shares after trading as high as seven earlier.  Howard Harlow, analyst at Whale Securities Corp, said Anacomp's earnings for fiscal 1987 ending September 31 could be doubled to 80 cts a share from the 40 cts a share he had forecast before Anacomp agreed to buy DatagraphiX, a micrographics firm, from General Dynamics Corp &lt;GD>.  "The company can earn 80 cts a share in fiscal 1987, maybe as much as a dlr a share, because of DatagraphiX," Harlow said. "Most of the benefit will be in the fourth qtr because it will integrate the company in the second half."  Anacomp's earnings will be less if it has problems integrating DatagraphiX, Harlow said.  A spokesman at Anacomp said the company expects to complete its deal for DatagraphiX later this month. She would not say how much it will pay for DatagraphiX, but noted that DatagraphiX contributed 10 mln dlrs in earnings to General Dynamics on revenues of 239 mln dlrs in 1986.  Harlow said a fellow analyst at Whale Securities estimates that Anacomp will pay between 100 mln dlrs to 150 mln dlrs for DatagraphiX. "The estimates on the street narrow it down to between 110 mln dlrs and 130 mln dlrs," Harlow added.  Anacomp reported net of 2.8 mln dlrs or nine cts a share in its first qtr ended December 31, up from 301,000 dlrs or one ct a share.  In Anacomp's fiscal 1986 it earned 4,073,000 dlrs or 13 cts a share.  Whale Securities recommends buying the stock, Harlow said.  Reuter &#3;

Export Credits Guarantee Department has named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay's Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17 years, to the post of executive director, a department spokesman said.  Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57.  A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent years.  Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top convern, adding that the department may have to compete more aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar services.  The department's annual report for the year ended March 31, 1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7 billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg.  Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports.  The agency will have to review its policies on insuring export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis, he said. "Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of thing we want to take a look at."  "You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing," Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance recipients.  He noted that certain countries have already been removed from the list.  REUTER &#3;
Visible stocks of 17 oils and fats are probably peaking now and are likely to fall sharply by October 1 this year, the Oil World newsletter said.  Oil World forecast that stocks of oils and fats may be cut to only 9.8 mln tonnes at the end of this season, compared with 10.6 mln a year earlier.  Its survey covered 13 oils -- soy, cotton, groundnut, sun, rape, sesame, corn, olive, coconut, palmkernel, palm, lin and castor -- and four animal oils and fats -- butter, fish oil, lard and tallow/greases.  Oil World's analysis predicted only a slight production increase of 0.5 mln tonnes in the year to end-September 1987, compared with increases of 3.6 mln and 4.0 mln tonnes in the previous two seasons.  It said world consumption was continuing to rise. Unusually low prices prevailing since early 1986 had stimulated demand for both food and non-food purposes, it said.  World consumption could increase by a record 2.8 mln tonnes to 71.8 mln tonnes this season and would be even higher if the Indian government did not artificially curb domestic demand.  Oil World said it did not expect the European Community (EC) to introduce a vegetable oils tax, but if such a tax were introduced it would have a negative impact on EC consumption.  Reuter &#3;
Coffee producing countries must quickly map out a fresh common strategy following the failure of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement on export quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's private coffee exporters' association, said.  Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing now would be to seek a unifying stand from producers, including Brazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices.  An ICO special meeting ended last night in London with exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a resumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago after prices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil.  Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly plummet.  However, he said the market should also take into account evident factors such as Brazil's low stocks and the sale of the near totality of the Central American crop.  Trade sources said Colombia's coffee was today quoted at 1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past 10 years.  Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understand the true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nations as well as for industrialized countries.  It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made to solve the problem of the developing world's external debt, decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repaying those debts, he said.  "In Colombia's case, we watch with consternation that, while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking, countries which support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein," Cardenas said.

Tender Loving Care Health Care Services Inc said it and Staff Buildiers Inc have extended the term of their merger agreement until May 31.  Tender Loving Care also said &lt;Norrell Corp> agreed not to acquire any additional Staff Builders shares until September 30, adding Norrell was paid 750,000 dlrs for the standstill arrangement.  Tender Loving Care said it agreed to buy the 610,000 Staff Builders common held by Norrell, about 19.1 pct of those outstanding, for 6,950,000 dlrs immediately prior to the consummation of the merger.  Tender Loving Care said the extended merger agreement continues to provide for the exchange of 1.6 of its shares for each Staff Builders share outstanding.  As announced February 26, the Staff Builders shareholders meeting to vote on the merger, originally convened and adjourned December 23, will be reconvened on April 22.  Tender Loving Care said its payment to Norrell will include 1,950,000 dlrs in cash and five mln dlrs of a new series of eight pct Tender Loving Care convertible preferred.  Tender Loving Care said it and Staff Builders have filed a revised registration and proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Upon clearance of the revised proxy statement by the commission and its distribution to Staff Builders' shareholders, that company's management will continue to solicit proxies for approval of the merger.  Tender Loving Care said it will have the power to vote about 15.8 pct of Staff Builders' shares at the adjourned meeting with a spokesman explaining that this represents the proxies held by Norrell, which started buying the stock after the record date for the meeting.  In addition, Staff Builders officers and directors own about 13.8 pct of its stock and have agreed to vote in favor of the merger.  Accordingly, the vote of an additional 37.1 pct of the outstanding shares will be required to approve the merger, Tender Loving Care said.  Reuter &#3;
The 1987 outlook for U.S. auto sales is clouded by a decidedly mixed sales forecast, and analysts who follow the industry say it is also true for companies that sell parts and equipment to the major car and truck manufacturers.  But while there are only four major U.S.-based automakers whose shares are traded on stock exchanges, there are thousands of big and small suppliers who sell a flood of original and replacement parts.  Analysts who follow the parts industry say there are many opportunities for investors brought on by the auto industry's intensified competition and the large volume of production in North America planned by Japanese automakers.  But assessing the supplier arena is far more complicated than for investors considering the stocks of the Detroit Big Three - General Motors Corp &lt;GM>, Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and Chrysler Corp &lt;C>.  Despite widespread predictions that U.S. vehicle sales will decline about 10 pct from the record 1987 levels, Wall Street financial experts are still generally bullish on Ford and somewhat less so on Chrysler.  And analysts remain largely neutral to bearish on GM, the industry giant whose earnings have been dropping along with its sales as it struggles to reorganize and shed its unprofitable parts-making businesses.  more &#3;
Soviet imports of soymeal may reach or exceed one mln tonnes between January and September this year, the Oil World newsletter said.  Oil World said it was likely the Soviet Union would reduce soybean imports and step up significantly its imports of meal.  At least 500,000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from the European Community and South America in the January/March quarter, with additional large quantities likely to be imported in the April and July quarters from Argentina and Brazil, it said. No figures were given for imports in the corresponding periods of 1986.  The change made sense in view of the recent purchases of probably 250,000 tonnes of West European and Polish rapeseed and large scale butter imports that were expected from March onward, it said.  Oil World said substantial losses of Soviet winter grain area due to recent severe frosts were probably behind the recent pick-up in Soviet purchases of U.S. Corn.  It noted that an additional one mln tonnes of U.S. Corn had been bought recently by the Soviet Union.  Reuter &#3;
