      "ROGUEOPTS".  Rogue will hear your name if you do so when you 
      begin a game.

    2) I changed it to be able to set a user name with a command-line 
      option.  From a command-line, please set a user name following a 
      "-n" option as follows.  You can use "?" to input a name later. 

        % rogue36 -n username
        % rogue36 -n ?

    3) For a person except the English zone, I bundled batch file to 
      run a command-line with English mode.  Please double-click 
      "cmd_us.bat".
