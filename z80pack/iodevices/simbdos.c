 *
 * This module provides host file I/O using a BDOS-like interface.
 * Presently, functionality is limited to those features required
 * to move files between the host and CP/M file systems.
 *
 * Use OPENF to open a host file for reading. Use MAKEF to create
 * and open a host file for writing. CLOSEF should be called when
 * file I/O is completed even if a file was only opened for reading.
 *
 * All requests come in through the host_bdos_out function. This
 * function is called via an OUT instruction mapped in iosim.c.
 *
 * Files written to the host are treated as binary files unless
 * the file extension is found in the "textExts" table below. A
 * binary file is always written as 128 byte sectors all the way
 * through the last sector of the CP/M file. A text file is written
 * as 128 byte sectors until an EOF character (0x1A, ctrl-z) is found.
 * This results in the last write typically being less than 128 bytes.
 *
 * The CP/M programs R.COM and W.COM use this interface to transfer
 * files between the host and CP/M file systems. Note that on a
 * case-sensitive operating system, file names must be in all caps
 * as used in CP/M.
 *
 * History:
 * 03-OCT-2019 (Mike Douglas) Original
