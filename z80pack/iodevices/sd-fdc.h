 * Z80SIM  -  a Z80-CPU simulator

 * Copyright (C) 2024, by Udo Munk
 *
 * This FDC does not emulate any existing hardware,
 * special not these with some LSI chip, it is designed
 * for bare metal with disk images on MicroSD and such.
 * It needs one single I/O port, send command to the port,
 * read result what it did, done. It does DMA transfer of
 * a complete sector. It has a rock solid state engine,
 * that can not get stuck by some software sending random
 * data, is all ignored. It is platform independend, the
 * platform must provide the low level functions, which
 * depend on what storage hardware actually is used.
 *
 * History:
 * 23-MAY-2024 implemented FDC, CP/M boot code & CBIOS
