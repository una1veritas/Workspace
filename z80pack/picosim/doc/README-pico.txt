Let's have a brief look at the hardware, I've setup the dev prototype
on breadboard, which is a good thing as you will see in a moment ;-)

picoboard1:
Shows my initial setup, just a Raspberry Pi Pico WH on a breadboard, a simple
switch with 10 K pull down resistor that causes an interrupt and stops
the emulated CPU. There is one additional LED which you can ignore, I use
it to simulate a Pico to see, if I got the configurations for the different
boards correct. The UART lines are connected to a Raspberry debug probe,
I got that for the case that I really have to poke around in the thing
with gdb. Not needed so far, should be fine to use a simple TTL to USB
adapter.

picoboard2:
Here you see that I got an Adafruit MicroSD drive already in place, which
is not wired yet. This is because I noticed that I used one of the SPI
pins of the primary SPI interface for the break switch. Read the data sheet
more carefully next time, but thanks to breadboard this is easy to fix, I
connected the break switch to a different port.
The MicroSD drive is a 3.3V one and it supports SPI and SDIO, I'll first
use SPI, that should be fast enough for what I want.

picoboard3:
And here the MicroSD drive is wired and I can read/write files on the card.
I have connected four of the GND pins of the Pico board with the GND lines
on the breadboard. The card drives can draw 100 mA, so better provide
sufficient GND. Also please note the two blocking capacitors, these are
to keep radio emissions low.

picoboard4:
I removed the monochrome LED and instead added a breakout board with a
WS2811 RGB LED. With this we can show stati of the machine by using
different colors, show access to the disk drives, or blink it from
the emulated CPU's. These RGB LED's need 5V power, which is available
at pin 40 coming from the USB connection. The data in pin is connected
to GPIO 14 and the 3.3V logic level from the GPIO is fine to program the
LED, a logic level shifter is not needed.

picoboard5:
I replaced the stackable RTC module with a breakout one, so that I have
persistent time/date informations for any MCU board. On this picture
you'll see that I'm currently using the new Pico 2 RP2350 board.

I added a battery backed RTC, so that date and time stays current, without
the need to set it all the time. For my breadboard research system I used
the stackable module from Waveshare:
https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Pico-RTC-DS3231

After I got my first Pico 2 boards I found that separating the stacked
modules is impossible without breaking the boards, this sits very tight.
This is fine for some final system, but not for a breadboard machine,
where I want to swap the MCU boards often. Will get replaced with a
DS3231 on breakout board, done as shown with picoboard5.
