On your MicroSD card create a directory DISKS80 and copy the *.dsk files
into it. When you run the picosim machine and you want to boot an OS,
put a bootable disk image into drive 0. The disk images are:

cpm22.dsk	- Yeah well, good old CP/M 2.2 for 8080 (bootable)
cpm3gen.dsk	- used to bring up CP/M 3 on CP/M 2.2 (NOT bootable)
cpm3-1.dsk	- CP/M 3 system disk 1 for 8080 (bootable)
cpm3-2.dsk	- CP/M 3 system disk 2 for 8080 (NOT bootable)
mpm-1.dsk	- MP/M II system disk 1 for Z80 and Pico 2 only (bootable)
mpm-2.dsk	- MP/M II system disk 2 for Z80 and Pico 2 only (NOT bootable)
empty.dsk	- empty CP/M disk, we often need one (NOT bootable)

fig80.dsk	- FIG Forth for the 8080, versions 1.1 and 1.3 (bootable)
fig80scr.dsk	- Forth block device with source screens for editor, 8080
		  assembler, tools. Use with FIG Forth only, other OS's
		  likely will corrupt the disk.

ucsd1.dsk	- UCSD p-System system disk 1 for 8080 (bootable)
ucsd2.dsk	- UCSD p-System system disk 2 for 8080 (NOT bootable)
ucsdint.dsk	- UCSD p-System interpreter, used to reconfigure system
		  (NOT bootable)
ucsdgame.dsk	- UCSD p-System games with sources (NOT bootable)
