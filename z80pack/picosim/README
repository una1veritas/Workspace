This is a Raspberry Pi Pico research machine I have build on a breadboard.
For hardware description read:

	doc/README-pico.txt

If you don't want to build a machine your self, there are ready fabricated
systems on PCB available, which can run the software. I have implemented
picosim also on these:

	https://github.com/udo-munk/RP2xxx-GEEK-80
	https://github.com/udo-munk/Pico-Eval-Board-80

To build the software you need to have the SDK 2.1.1 for RP2040/RP2350 devices
installed and configured. The SDK manual has detailed instructions how
to install on all major PC platforms, it is available here:

https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html

Now you can build picosim for the Pico RP2040 with these commands:

	cd z80pack/picosim/srcsim
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
	make -j

To build picosim for the Pico 2 RP2350 (you can also use
PICO_PLATFORM=rp2350-riscv if you have the appropriate RISC-V toolchain
installed):

	cd z80pack/picosim/srcsim
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -D PICO_PLATFORM=rp2350-arm-s -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
	make -j

The machine is configured for USB UART so that no additional parts are needed
to hook up a terminal. The default UART also is enabled, to use connect a
TTL/USB adapter or a pico probe to the default UART pins for the board
(GP0 & GP1).

This machine can be used with Pico and Pico W boards, it is setup
for a Pico board. To setup for a Pico W comment/uncomment the lines
in CMakeLists.txt.
A Pico W tries to connect to WiFi and if that worked tries to get date/time via NTP
over the WiFi connection. The date/time is used to set the system clock then.
This also should work with a Pico 2 W, but has not been tested yet, need to get a board
sometime.

Preparing a MicroSD card:
In the root directory of the card create these directories:
CONF80
CODE80
DISKS80

Into the CODE80 directory copy all the .bin files from src-examples.
Into the DISKS80 directory copy the disk images from disks.
CONF80 is used to save the configuration, nothing more to do there,
the directory must exist though.
