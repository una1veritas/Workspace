 * This is the configuration I'm using for software testing and debugging
 *
 * History:
 * 15-SEP-2019 (Mike Douglas) Created from sim.h from the z80sim source
 *	       directory. Set start-up message for Mostek AID-80F and SYS-80FT
 *	       computers.
 * 27-SEP-2019 (Udo Munk) modified for integration into 1.37
 * 25-APR-2024 (Udo Munk) this was a Z80 machine and we can exclude 8080 now
 * 14-DEC-2024 (Thomas Eberhardt) added hardware breakpoint support
