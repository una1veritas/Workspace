This is a simulator for the Intel Intellec MDS-800 system with 64K
RAM, an iSBC-202 double density diskette controller with 4 drives
attached, an iSBC-201 single density diskette controller with 2 drives
attached, and an iSBC-206 hard disk controller with 2 MDS-740 hard
disk units attached. Each MDS-740 unit contains a fixed platter and a
removable IBM-5440 type platter.

The front panel picture (conf/intelmds.jpg) comes from the front page
of https://www.facebook.com/groups/IntellecMDS .

The CP/M disk image was downloaded from
https://www.nj7p.info/Computers/Old%20Software/software.html .

Disk image files are mapped as follows:
drivea.dsk	Unit 0 of iSBC-202 (DD diskette)
driveb.dsk	Unit 1 of iSBC-202 (DD diskette)
drivec.dsk	Unit 2 of iSBC-202 (DD diskette)
drived.dsk	Unit 3 of iSBC-202 (DD diskette)
drivee.dsk	Unit 0 of iSBC-201 (SD diskette)
drivef.dsk	Unit 1 of iSBC-201 (SD diskette)
drivei.dsk	Unit 0 of iSBC-206 (fixed HD)
drivej.dsk	Unit 0 of iSBC-206 (removable HD)
drivek.dsk	Unit 1 of iSBC-206 (fixed HD)
drivel.dsk	Unit 1 of iSBC-206 (removable HD)

Drive letters in CP/M correspond to the image names.

For a hard drive unit to be ready both (fixed & removable) disk image
files must exist.

For cpmtools use the usual default "ibm-3740" for SD disk images,
"mds-dd" for DD disk images and the following definition for hard disk
images:

diskdef mds-hd
  seclen 128
  tracks 200
  sectrk 144
  blocksize 4096
  maxdir 1024
  skew 0
  boottrk 0
  os 2.2
end

For added convenience there is a "diskdefs" file in the disks
directory, since cpmtools looks in the current directory first for its
disk definitions file.

To create a DD disk image for the machine:

dd if=/dev/zero of=name.dsk bs=128 count=4004
mkfs.cpm -f mds-dd name.dsk

for a hard disk image use:

dd if=/dev/zero of=name.dsk bs=128 count=28800
mkfs.cpm -f mds-hd name.dsk
