The monitor ROM source code comes from the files
monitors/MDS-I/{b1v12.asm,m1v20.asm} out of Bill Beech's
https://www.nj7p.info/Computers/work/Intel-run.7z .

It was compared to
https://mark-ogden.uk/files/intel/publications/9800155D%20Intellec%20MDS%20Monitor%20V2.0-SEP75.pdf
and corrected (lots of OCR errors in the comments) and produces the same code
(except for filler bytes) as the files in
http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/intel/MDS800/firmware/ .
