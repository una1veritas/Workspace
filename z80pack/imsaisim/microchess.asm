; TYPED IN HEXDUMP FROM THE MANUAL AND APPLIED PATCHES
; FROM THE OCTOBER 1977 MICROCHESS NOTES.
;
; BY DEFAULT THE PROGRAM USES TERMINAL I/O FOR
; A CROMEMCO TU-ART. BY SETTING ONE OF MITS
; OR IMSAI TO 1, THE TERMINAL I/O ROUTINES ARE
; PATCHED FOR A MITS 2SIO OR IMSAI SIO2.
;
; ADDED THE DOCUMENTED PATCHES FOR DISPLAY OPTIONS.
; ADDED PATCHES TO MAKE IT WORKING UNDER CP/M.
;
; UDO MUNK, OCTOBER 2016
;
; ADDED PATCH TO DISPLAY A SMALL BOARD WITH COORDINATES.
; ADDED DAZZLER OUPUT USING 8080 INSTRUCTIONS ONLY.
; MADE PATCH FOR BOARD WITH COORDINATES RELOCATABLE.
; FIRST SWITCH DAZZLER ON AND THEN DRAW BOARD, SO THAT
; IT ALSO WORKS WITH DAZZLER II.
; IMPROVED CP/M PATCH, NOW ALSO SAVES IOBYTE, SOME BIOS'S
; NEED IT.
