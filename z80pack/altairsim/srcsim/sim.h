 * 14-MAR-2014 added Tarbell SD FDC and printer port
 * 23-MAR-2014 enabled interrupts, 10ms timer added to iosim
 * xx-JUN-2014 added default CPU define
 * 19-JUL-2014 added typedef for signed 16-bit
 * 29-APR-2015 added Cromemco DAZZLER to the machine
 * 11-AUG-2016 implemented memwrt as function to support ROM
 * 01-DEC-2016 implemented memrdr to separate memory from CPU
 * 06-DEC-2016 implemented status display and stepping for all machine cycles
 * 12-JAN-2017 improved configuration and front panel LED timing
 * 26-FEB-2017 added Processor Technology VDM-1 to the machine
 * 27-MAR-2017 added SIO's connected to UNIX domain sockets
 * 10-APR-2018 trap CPU on unsupported bus data during interrupt
 * 07-MAY-2018 added memory configuration needed by apple monitor
 * 21-AUG-2018 improved memory configuration
 * 29-AUG-2021 new memory configuration sections
 * 09-MAY-2024 added more defines for conditional compiling components
 * 14-DEC-2024 added hardware breakpoint support
