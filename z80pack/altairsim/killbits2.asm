;  KILL THE BIT GAME BY DEAN MCDANIEL, MAY 15, 1975
;
;  OBJECT: KILL THE ROTATING BIT. IF YOU MISS THE LIT BIT, ANOTHER
;          BIT TURNS ON LEAVING TWO BITS TO DESTROY. QUICKLY 
;          TOGGLE THE SWITCH, DON'T LEAVE THE SWITCH IN THE UP
;          POSITION. BEFORE STARTING, MAKE SURE ALL THE SWITCHES
;          ARE IN THE DOWN POSITION.
;
;  MODIFIED BY MIKE DOUGLAS, JULY 2019, TO DEMONSTRATE USE OF THE
;  INCREMENTER/DECREMENTER IN THE 8080, WHICH AS A SIDE EFFECT,
;  DRIVES THE ADDRESS BUS, AND HENCE, THE FRONT PANEL LEDS, DURING
;  THE EXECUTE CYCLE OF 16 BIT INCREMENT AND DECREMENT INSTRUCTIONS.
