The SIO port implemented is compatible with MITS SIO Rev. 1, so that
all software using it runs on this machine.

Also port 255, which is used by frontpanel machines for system
configuration, can be set with the "p fe" command to any desired
value, the default is 0. Yes, port 254, which is a mirror of port 255
to allow setting the configuration, since writing to port 255 would
set the port LEDs on a frontpanel machine.

For MITS BASIC Versions < 4.0 the port 255 value needs to be 0, for
Versions >= 4.0 the correct setting is 22H. Do not try to run Version
1.0, because it requires a MITS SIO Rev. 0, won't work.

Also do not just hit return at the MEMORY SIZE question, enter some
value. This is old software and at the time it was written no one
imagined that one day we have machines with 64 KB RAM. If the software
tries to figure out how much RAM is there, it wrapps from FFFFH to
0000H and then destroys it self. Later versions fixed this, go figure.
