1. utility.c uses "getpw (getuid (), name)", which according to
   Rick Adams @ Seismo is obsolete.  no fix made here.  Caveat Emptor!

2. Peter Wan reports problems with screen handling on terminals with
   no tabs.  Jeff Anton at Berkeley replies that putting "GT=0"
   after the call to initscr() in main.c will force curses to use
   spaces or cursor positioning, so this hack will make the program
   work on terminals without tabs.
