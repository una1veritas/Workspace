The fictitious chemical, kryptocyanic acid, can only be diluted by the
ratio of 7 parts water to 3 parts acid. Any other ratio causes an
unstable compound which soon explodes. Given an amount of acid, you
must determine how much water to add for dilution. If you're more than
5% off, you lose one of your nine lives. The program continues to play
until you lose all nine lives or until it is interrupted.
