This is a simulated bowling game for up to four players. You play 10
frames. To roll the ball, you simply type "ROLL". After each roll, the
computer will show you a diagram of the remaining pins ("0" means a
pin is down "+" means it is still standing), and it will give you a
roll analysis:
GUTTER
STRIKE
SPARE
ERROR (on second ball if pins still standing)

Bowling was written by Paul Peraino while a student at Woodrow Wilson
High School, San Francisco, California.
