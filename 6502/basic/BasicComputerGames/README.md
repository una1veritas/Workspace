These are programs from the book "Basic Computer Games Microcomputer
Edition" by David H. Ahl, 1978.

They have been adapted where needed to run on the version of Microsoft
Basic used on the Ohio Scientific Superboard II computer, "OSI 6502
Basic version 1.0 rev 3.2."

Most games have instructions in the .txt file corresponding to the
.bas file for the game.

Porting Notes:

All programs have been tested on an Ohio Scientific Superboard II with
8K or 32K of RAM.

The 24 column screen means that some output can be hard to read.

Some lines that were more than 72 characters long were shortened.

Banner.bas is not working. Need to review why (many people reported
this on other systems).

Blackjack.bas, CivilWar.bas, and SuperStarTrek.bas will not run on a
system with only 8K of RAM.
