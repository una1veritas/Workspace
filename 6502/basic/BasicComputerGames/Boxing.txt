This program simulates a three-round Olympic boxing match. The
computer coaches one of the boxers and determines his punches and
defenses, while you do the same for your boxer. At the start of the
match, you may specify your man's best punch and his vulnerability.

There are approximately seven major punches per round, although this
can be varied in Statement 185. The best two out of three rounds wins.

Jesse Lynch of St. Paul, Minnesota created this program.
