In this game, up to 20 players throw darts at a target with 10-, 20-,
30-, and 40-point zones. The objective is to get 200 points.

You have a choice of three methods of throwing:

Throw  Description         Probable Score
1      Fast overarm        Bullseye or complete miss
2      Controlled overarm  10, 20, or 30 points
3      Underarm            Anything

You will find after playing a while that different players will swear
by different strategies. However, consider the expected score per
throw by always using Throw 3 (program line 220).

Score (S)  Probability (P)  SxP
  40       1.00-.95 = .05    2
  30       .95-.75 = 0.20    6
  30       .74-.45 = 0.30    6
  10       .45-.05 - 0.40    4
   0       .05-.00 = .05     0
                            ---
Expected score per throw =  18

Calculate the expected scores for the other throws and you may be
surprised!
