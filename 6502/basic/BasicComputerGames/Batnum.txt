The game starts with an imaginary pile of objects, coins for example.
You and your opponent (the computer) alternately remove objects from
the pile. You specify in advance the minimum and maximum number of
objects that can be taken on each turn.

You also specify in advance how winning is defined: 1. to take the
last object or 2. To avoid taking the last object. You may also
determine whether you or the computer go first.

The strategy of this game is based on modulo arithmetic. If the
maximum number of objects a player may remove in a turn in M, then to
gain a winning position a player at the end of his turn must leave a
stack of 1 modulo (M+1) coins. If you don't understand this, play the
game 23 Matches first, and then BATNUM, and have fun!

BATNUM is a generalized version of a great number of manual
remove-the-object games. The original computer version was written by
one of the two originators of the BASIC language, John Kemeny of
Dartmouth College.
