In this simulated bullfight, you are the matador -- i.e. the one with
the principal role and the one who must kill the bull or be killed (or
run from the ring).

On each pass of the bull, you may try:
0 Veronica (dangerous outside move of the cape)
1 Less dangerous outside move of the cape
2 Ordinary swirl of the cape

Or you may try to kill the bull:
4 Over the horns
5 In the chest

The crowd will determine what award you deserve, posthumously if
necessary. The braver you are, the better the award you receive. It's
nice to stay alive too. The better the job the picadores and
toreadores do, the better your chances.

David Sweet of Dartmouth wrote the original version of this program.
It was then modified by students at Lexington High School and finally
Steve North of Creative Computing.
