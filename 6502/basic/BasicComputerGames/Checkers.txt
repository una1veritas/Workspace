This program plays checkers. The pieces played by the computer are
marked with an "X", yours are marked "O". A move is made by specifying
the coordinates of the piece to be moved (X,Y). Home (0,0) is in the
bottom left and X specifies distance to the right of home (i.e.,
column) and Y specifies distance above home (i.e., row). You then
specify where you wish to move to.

The original version of the program by Alan Segal was not able to
recognize (or permit) a double or triple jump. If you tried one, it
was likely that your piece would disappear altogether!

Steve North of Creative Computing rectified this problem and Lawrence
Neal contributed modifications to allow the program to tell which
player has won the game. The computer does not play a particularly
good game but we leave it up to you to improve that.
