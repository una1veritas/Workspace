This program prints out a calendar for any year. You must specify the
starting day of the week of the year in Statement 130. (Sunday (0),
Monday (-1), Tuesday (-2), etc.). You can determine this by using the
program WEEKDAY. You must also make two changes for leap years in
Statements 360 and 620. The program listing describes the necessary
changes. Running the progrm produces a nice 12-month calendar.

The program was written by Geoffrey Chase of the Abbey, Portsmouth
Rhode Island.
