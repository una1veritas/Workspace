This program is an adaptation of a mathematical game originally
described by Martin Gardner in the January 1973 issue of Scientific
American. Up to a 9x9 grid is set up by you with the upper left square
a poison square. This grid is the cookie. Players alternately chomp
away at the cookie from the lower right. To take a chomp, input a row
and column number of one of the squares remaining on the cookie. All
of the squares below and to the right of that square, including that
square disappear.

Any number of people can play -- the computer is only the moderator;
it is not a player. Two-person strategies are interesting to work out
but strategies when three or more people are playing are a real
challenge.

The computer version of the game was written by Peter Sessions of
People's Computer Company.
