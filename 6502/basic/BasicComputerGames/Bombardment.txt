BOMBARDMENT is played on two 5x5 grids or boards with 25 outpost
locations numbered 1 to 25. Both you and the computer have four
platoons of troops that can be located at any four outposts on your
respective grids.

At the start of the game, you locate (or hide) your four platoons on
your grid. The computer does the same on its grid. You then take turns
firing missiles or bombs at each other's outposts trying to destroy
all four platoons. The one who finds all four opponents' platoons
first, wins.

This program was slightly modified from the original written by Martin
Burdash of Parlin, New Jersey.
