CUBE is a game played on the facing sides of a cube with a side
dimension of 2. A location is designated by three numbers -- e.g. 1,
2, 1. The object is to travel from 1, 1, 1 to 3, 3, 3 by moving one
horizontal or vertical (not diagonal) square at a time without
striking one of the randomly placed landmines. You are staked to $500;
prior to each play of the game you may make a wager whether you will
reach your destination. You lose if you hit a mine or try to make an
illegal move -- i.e. change more than one digit from your previous
position.

Cube was created by Jermimac Ratliff of Fort Worth, Texas.
