This simulation is based on 14 battles in the Civil War. Facts and
figures used are based on the actual occurrence. If you follow the
same strategy used in the actual battle, the results will be the same.
Generally, this is a good strategy since the generals in the Civil War
were fairly good military strategists. However, you can frequently
outperform the Civil War generals, particularly in cases where they
did not have good enemy intelligence and consequently followed a poor
course of action. Naturally, it helps to know your Civil War history,
although the computer gives you the rudiments.

After each of the 14 battles, your casualties are compared to the
actual casualties of the battle, and you are told whether you win or
lose the battle.

You may play Civil War alone in which case the program simulates the
Union general. Or two players may play in which case the computer
becomes the moderator.

Civil War was written in 1968 by three students at Lexington High
School, Massachusetts: L. Cram, L. Goodie, and D. Hibard. It was
modified into a 2-player game by G.Paul and R. Hess of TIES, St.
Paul, Minnesota.
