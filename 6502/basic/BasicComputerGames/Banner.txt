This program creates a large banner on a terminal of any message you
input. The length of the message may be as long as a string variable
permits in your version of BASIC. The letters may be any dimension you
wish although the letter height plus distance from left hand side
should not exceed 6 inches. Experiment with the height and width until
you get a pleasing effect on whatever terminal you are using. The
permissible letters and characters are defined in the data statements
899 through 940.

Many people seem to have trouble getting this program to work,
however, after thorough checking we guarantee that the version
presented here runs correctly. We suspect that the problem is
dependent on the Basic itself and the way it reads and restores data
files.

This program was written by Leonard Rosendust of Brooklyn, New York.
