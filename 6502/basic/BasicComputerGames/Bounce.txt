This program plots a bouncing ball. Most computer plots run along the
paper in the terminal (top to bottom); however this plot is drawn
horizontally on the paper (left to right).

You may specify the initial velocity of the ball and the coefficient
of elasticity (a superball is about 0.85 - other balls are much less).
You also specify the time increment to be used in "strobing" the
flight of the ball. In other words, it is as though the ball is thrown
up in a darkened room and you flash a light at fixed time intervals
and photograph the progress of the ball.

The program was originally written by Val Skalabrin while he was at
DEC.
