In the words of the program author, John Graham, "CHIEF is designed to
give people (mostly kids) practice in the four operations (addition,
multiplication, subtraction, and division). It does this while giving
people some fun. And then, if the people are wrong, it shows them how
they should have done it."

CHIEF was written by John Graham of Upper Brookville, New York.
