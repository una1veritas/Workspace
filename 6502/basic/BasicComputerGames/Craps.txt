This game simulates the game of craps played according to the standard
Nevada craps table rules. That is:

1. A 7 or 11 on the first roll wins.
2. A 2, 3, or 12 on the first roll loses.
3. Any other number rolled becomes your "point". You continue to roll;
   if you get your point you win. If you roll a 7, you lose and the
   dice change hands when this happens.

This version of craps was modified by Steve North of Creative
Computing. It is based on an original which appeared one day on a
computer at DEC.
