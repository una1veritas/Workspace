In this game you are fighting a small-scale war with the computer. You
have 72,000 troops which you must first distribute among your Army,
Navy, and Air Force. You may distribute them in any way you choose as
long as you don't use more than 72,000.

You then attack your opponent (the computer) and input which service
and the number of men you wish to use. The computer then tells you the
outcome of the battle, give you the current statistics and allows you
to determine your next move.

After the second battle, it is decided from the total statistics
whether you win or lose or if a treaty is signed.
