This is a simulation of the card game of Blackjack or 21, Las Vegas
style. This rather comprehensive version allows for up to seven
players. On each hand each player may get another card (a hit), stand,
split a hand in the event two identical cards were received, or double
down. Also, the dealer will ask for an insurance bet if he has an
exposed ace.

Cards are automatically reshuffled as the 51st card is reached. For
greater realism, you may wish to change this to the 41st card in Line
110. Actually, fanatical purists will want to modify the program so it
uses three decks of cards instead of just one.

This program originally surfaced at Digital Equipment Corp.; the
author is unknown.
