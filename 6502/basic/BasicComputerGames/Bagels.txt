In this game, the computer picks a 3-digit secret number using the
digits 0 to 9 and you attempt to guess what it is. You are allowed up
to twenty guesses. No digit is repeated. After each guess the
computer will give you clues about your guess as follows:

PICO    One digit is correct, but in the wrong place.

FERMI   One digit is in the correct place.

BAGELS  No digit is correct.

You will learn to draw inferences from the clues, and, with practice,
you'll learn to improve your score. There are several good strategies
for playing Bagels. After you have found a good strategy, see if you
can improve it. Or try a different strategy altogether and see if it
is any better. While the program allows up to twenty guesses, if you
use a good strategy it should not take more than eight guesses to get
any number.

The original authors of this program are D. Resek and P. Rowe of the
Lawrence Hall of Science, Berkeley, California.
