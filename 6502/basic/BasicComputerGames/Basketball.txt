This program simulates a game of basketball between Dartmouth College
and an opponent of your choice. You are the Dartmouth captain and
control the type of shot and defense during the course of the game.

There are four types of shots: 1. Long Jump Shot (30 ft.), 2. Short
Jump Shot (15 ft.), 3. Lay up, and 4. Set Shot.

Both teams use the same defense, but you may call it: Press (6),
Man-to-man (6.5), Zone (7), or none (7.5). To change defense, type "0"
as your next shot.

Note: The game is biased slightly in favor of Dartmouth. The average
probability of a Dartmouth shot being good is 62.95% compared to a
probably of 61.85% for their opponent.

Charles Bachellor of Dartmouth College was the original author of this
game.
