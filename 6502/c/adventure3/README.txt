James's The Prisoner Adventure is a sequel to The Abandoned Farmhouse
and Skye's Castle adventures, a text adventure game in the spirit of
similar games that ran on 8-bit microcomputers of the 1970s and 80s or
the more ambitious Colossal Cave adventure that originally only ran on
mainframes and minicomputers.

The plot and game should be self-explanatory. Figuring it out is the
point of the game.

It was written to run on platforms supported by cc65 although it is in
portable C and should run on any system with a C compiler (I did most
of the development and testing on a Linux system). See the Makefile
for commands and instruction on how to build and install it on various
platforms.

The source is included and under an Apache license so you can modify
and adapt the code if you wish. Much of the code is data-driven and
could be used to implement an entirely different adventure just by
changing the map, strings, and some of the logic that handles special
actions.

The location for the adventure is based on the 1960's television
series The Prisoner.
