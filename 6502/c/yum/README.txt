This is a computer version of the game YUM, similar to games known as
Yahtzee, Yacht and Generala. Each player rolls five dice up to three
times and then applies the dice toward a category to claim points. The
game has 12 rounds during which each player attempts to claim the most
points in each category.

The winner is the person scoring the most points at the end of the
game.

This version supports up to three players of which any can be human or
computer players.

Categories are as follows:

1's through 6's - dice of same type.

Low Straight - 1 2 3 4 5.

High Straight - 2 3 4 5 6.

Low Score - total 21 or more and lower than High Score.

High Score - total 22 or more and higher than Low Score.

Full House - 3 of a kind and a pair.

YUM - 5 dice the same.

There is a bonus of 25 points awarded if the upper section is 63 or more.

It was written in standard C but designed to run on the Apple Replica 1
using the CC65 6502 compiler/assembler.

Because it was intended to run on the Replica 1 it was kept small and
efficient to run within the 32K memory limit and only use uppercase
characters and fit on a 40x24 character screen.
