Overview
========

This game helps you learn and improve
your knowledge of boolean algebra as
used by electronic logic gates.

Given a circuit, you have to guess a
missing entry in the truth table,
i.e. the value of an input or output
that is valid for the circuit.

Alternatively, you can be shown a truth
table and need to identify the circuit
that matches it.

You can test your knowledge at
different skill levels, ranging from
simple one-gate circuits to circuits
with multiple logic gates.
