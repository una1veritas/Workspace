These are patches for the CC65 assembler/C compiler tools to add
support for my single board computer. The patches apply to the latest
version of cc65 and are periodically updated.

Apply the patch to the cc65 source and then build it as normal or use
the "build" script with suitable changes for your system.

It adds a new target called "sbc". See the files in the example folder
for some examples of how to build and run a C program.
