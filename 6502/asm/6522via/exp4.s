; Experiment 3
;
; Measure frequency on PB6 input.
; Use Timer 2 to count pulses.
; User Timer 1 to set time period.
; Output value to screen.
; Enhancement would be to make this interrupt driven but want to keep it simple for now.

; Example:
; Input was 100KHz
; Counted $13AE pulses = 5038 * 20 Hz = 10,076 Hz
; If wanted to convert to Hz, good sample rates might be 16, 32, or 64 since could multiply by shifting it.
; Input was an audio signal generator and then through a 74LS04 inverter to make sure levels were TTL.
