These are experimental patches for the CC65 assembler/C compiler tools
to add support to the osic1p platform for doing all i/o using the
cassette serial port rather than screen and keyboard. The patches
apply to the latest version of cc65 and are periodically updated.

Apply the patch to the cc65 source and then build it as normal or use
the "build" script with suitable changes for your system.
