; TWO TONE SOUND TO INDICATE HOURS

;     This is a subroutine which when added to the clock display
; routine will use the real time clock data to produce one sound
; per hour on the hour,  The output is a speaker circuit as shown
; on Pg. 57  of the KIM-1 Manual.  It is hooked to PB0 rather than
; PA0.  The specific notes can be changed by altering 0330 and 033C.
