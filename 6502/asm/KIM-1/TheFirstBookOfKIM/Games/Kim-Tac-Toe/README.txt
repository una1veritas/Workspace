KIM-TAC-TOE
BY LEW EDWARDS          

     DIRECTIONS -
          PLAY BEGINS WITH KIM MAKING THE FIRST PLAY WHEN
     "GO" IS PRESSED.  THE SECOND THROUGH FOURTH DIGITS OF
     THE DISPLAY HOLD THE PATTERN WITH SQUARES NUMBERED AS:
     YOUR ENTRY WILL BE IMMEDIATE BUT          7 8 9
     KIM'S ACTION WILL BE DELAYED.  YOUR       4 5 6
     PLAYS LIGHT STEADILY WHILE KIM'S          1 2 3
     FLICKER.  A WINNING ROW BLINKS AND A DRAW BLINKS
     EVERYTHING.  ON COMPLETION OF A GAME,  THE "GO" KEY WILL
     START A NEW GAME.  IF YOU PREFER TO PLAY FIRST, PRESS THE
     "+" KEY INSTEAD.  THE KIM HAS AN I.Q. LEVEL THAT CAN BE
     CHANGED BY PRESSING "PC" AT GAMES END.  YOU WILL SEE
     "ODDS" AND KIM'S I.Q. DISPLAYED.  THE I.Q. IS INITIALLY
     SET TO 75%, (OC).  CHANGE IT TO WHAT YOU WISH AND THEN
     PRESS "DA" TO RETURN TO THE DONE LOOP AND START A NEW
     GAME IN THE NORMAL MANNER.  THE I.Q. IS ADJUSTED UPWARD
     EACH TIME THE PLAYER WINS AND DOWNWARD EACH TIME KIM WINS.
     THE PROGRAM STARTS AT 0100.
