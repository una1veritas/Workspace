DESCRIPTION

THIS PROGRAM PLAYS ONE OR SEVERAL TUNES VIA THE "AUDIO OUT"
INTERFACE OF KIM-1; USE THE SAME CONNECTION AS THAT FOR
RECORDING ON CASSETTE TAPE. IF YOUR TAPE RECORDER HAS
A "MONITOR" FEATURE, YOU CAN LISTEN TO THE TUNE AS WELL
AS RECORD IT. ALTERNATIVELY, AN AMPLIFIER WILL PLAY THE
SIGNAL THROUGH A SPEAKER.

HOW TO RUN

LOAD THE PROGRAM; LOAD THE TUNE(S) EITHER FROM CASSETTE
TAPE, PAPER TAPE, OR KEYBOARD ENTRY.  BE SURE TO STORE
THE VALUE FA AT THE END OF EACH TUNE, AND BEHIND THE LAST
TUNE, STORE: FF 00.
STARTING ADDRESS FOR THE PROGRAM IS 200; ENTER AD 0 2 0 0 GO.

HOW TO WRITE YOUR OWN TUNE(S)

EACH NOTE GOES INTO A BYTE OF STORAGE, STARTING AT LOCATION
0000 OF MEMORY. EACH TUNE SHOULD END WITH THE VALUE FA
WHICH STOPS THE PROGRAM UNTIL GO IS PRESSED.

SPECIAL CODES ARE INCORPORATED IN THE PROGRAM TO ALLOW
CERTAIN EFFECTS - ADJUSTMENT OF SPEED, TONE, ETC.
THE CODES ARE FOLLOWED BY A VALUE WHICH SETS THE
PARTICULAR EFFECT.  CODES ARE LISTED BELOW:

     CODE         EFFECT        INITIALLY        EXAMPLES
      FB  SETS SPEED OF TUNE       $30    18 IS QUICK; 60 IS SLOW
      FC  SETS LENGTH OF            02    2 MEANS, "LONG NOTE LASTS
           "LONG" NOTES                   TWICE AS LONG AS SHORT"
      FD  SETS OCTAVE (PITCH)       01    2 IS BASS; 4 IS DEEP BASS.
      FE  SETS INSTRUMENT         $FF    FF IS PIANO; 00 IS CLARINET
      FF  SETS ADDRESS FOR         00    00 WILL TAKE YOU BACK TO
             TUNE                           FIRST TUNE; LIKE A "JUMP"

FOR EXAMPLE, AT ANY TIME DURING A TUNE, YOU MAY INSERT 
THE SEQUENCE FB 18 AND THE TUNE WILL THEN BEGIN TO PLAY 
AT FAST SPEED. INSERTING FF 45 WILL CAUSE A SWITCH TO 
THE TUNE AT ADDRESS 45.  THE INITIAL VALUES SHOWN CAN 
BE RESET AT ANY TIME BY STARTING AT ADDRESS 200.

NO TUNE SHOULD EXTEND BEYOND ADDRESS DF, SINCE PROGRAM 
VALUES ARE STORED AT E0 AND UP.

THE PROGRAM CAN BE EASILY CONVERTED TO A SUBROUTINE 
(BY REPLACING THE BRK INSTRUCTION WITH A RTS).  THIS ALLOWS 
THE PROGRAMMER TO PLAY VARIOUS "PHRASES" OF MUSIC TO 
PRODUCE QUITE COMPLEX TUNES.
