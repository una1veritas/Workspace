HI-LO
BY JIM BUTTERFIELD


  DESCRIPTION -

       AN EASY GAME FOR ONE OR MORE PLAYERS.  KIM CHOOSES A
  SECRET NUMBER FROM 01 TO 98.  AT THE START, THE FIRST FOUR
  DIGITS SHOW THE HIGH AND LOW BOUNDS OF THE NUMBER - 99 HIGH
  AND 00 LOW.  AS GUESSES ARE ENTERED - ENTER THE GUESS AND
  PRESS A FOR ATTEMPT - THE BOUNDS CHANGE AS YOU ARE NARROWING
  DOWN THE POSSIBILITIES.  FOR EXAMPLE, GUESS 32 AND THE DISPLAY
  MIGHT CHANGE TO 32 00, MEANING THAT THE COMPUTER'S SECRET
  NUMBER IS BETWEEN THESE VALUES.  AFTER EACH LEGAL GUESS,
  THE COMPUTER SHOWS THE NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS MADE SO FAR.

  ONE PLAYER GAME: TRY TO GET THE MYSTERY NUMBER IN SIX ATTEMPTS.

  MULTI PLAYER GAME: EACH PLAYER TRIES TO AVOID GUESSING THE
  MYSTERY NUMBER - THE CORRECT GUESSER LOSES AND IS "OUT".
