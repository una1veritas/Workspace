BAGELS
BY JIM BUTTERFIELD

DIRECTIONS -
THE COMPUTER HAS CHOSEN FOUR LETTERS, ALL OF WHICH ARE
A,B,C,D,E, OR F. LETTERS MAY BE REPEATED - FOR EXAMPLE,
THE COMPUTER'S "SECRET" COMBINATION MIGHT BE CACF OR BBBB.
YOU GET TEN GUESSES. EACH TIME YOU GUESS, THE COMPUTER
WILL TELL YOU TWO THINGS: HOW MANY LETTERS ARE EXACTLY CORRECT
(THE RIGHT LETTER IN THE RIGHT PLACE); AND HOW MANY LETTERS
ARE CORRECT, BUT IN THE WRONG POSITION.
FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE COMPUTER'S SECRET COMBINATION IS
CBFB AND YOU GUESS BAFD, THE TWO NUMBERS WILL BE 1 AND 1
(THE F MATCHES EXACTLY; THE B MATCHES BUT IN THE WRONG PLACE).
THESE NUMBERS WILL SHOW ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE DISPLAY;
THE CODE YOU ENTERED WILL APPEAR ON THE LEFT.
MAKE A NOTE OF YOUR GUESSES AND THE COMPUTER'S RESPONSE.
WITH A LITTLE MENTAL WORK, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BREAK THE
CODE EXACTLY IN SEVEN OR EIGHT WORDS. A CORRECT GUESS WILL
PRODUCE A RESPONSE OF 4 - 0. IF YOU DON'T GUESS RIGHT IN
TEN MOVES, THE COMPUTER WILL GIVE YOU THE ANSWER.
AFTER A CORRECT GUESS, OR AFTER THE COMPUTER TELLS YOU
THE ANSWER, IT WILL START A NEW GAME (WITH A NEW SECRET CODE)
THE INSTANT YOU TOUCH A NEW KEY.

Program notes :
1. Program enforces a pause of about 4 seconds after
displaying counts or answer. This guards against
display being 'missed' due to bounce, hasty keying.

2. After count displayed, or at end of game(s), user
can blank display, if desired, by pressing GO or
any numeric key. Game operation is not affected,
but user may feel it 'separates' games better.

3. When a digit from the user's guess is matched, it
is destroyed so that it will not be matched again.
There are two significantly different types of
'destruction', however (at 27D and 29D); the test
at label STEP is sensitive to which one is used.
