ADDITION

BY JIM BUTTERFIELD

DIRECTIONS -
HERE'S A HANDY LITTLE ADDING MACHINE PROGRAM. KIM BECOMES
A SIX DIGIT ADDER. "GO" CLEARS THE TOTAL SO YOU CAN START
OVER. THEN ENTER A NUMBER AND HIT THE PLUS KEY TO ADD IT
TO THE PREVIOUS TOTAL. IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE IN ENTERING
A NUMBER, JUST HIT THE "0" KEY SEVERAL TIMES AND ROLL THE
BAD NUMBER OUT BEFORE ENTERING THE CORRECTION. NO OVERFLOW
INDICATOR, AND NO SUBTRACTION OR MULTIPLICATION - MAYBE YOU
WOULD LIKE TO TRY YOUR HAND AT ADDING THESE. THE PROGRAM
IS FULLY RELOCATABLE.

Note: Needs to be out of decimal mode to work (CLD or 00 in 00F1).
