PLL SET
Lewis Edwards, Jr.

     Having trouble loading from tape, especially on "SUPERTAPE"?  Suspect
the PLL adjustment might be off, but were afraid to adjust it, or didn't
have a meter or scope handy?  Use this program and KIM's built in hardware
to make the adjustment.  Hold the tip of the plug you plug into the tape
recorder's earphone jack to applications pin #14 and adjust the control
for 0's or combinations of 7'S and L's on the display.  "L" means the PLL
TEST line is low and "7" means it's high.  The program generates a signal
that alternates slightly below and slightly above the one generated by KIM
at 1A6B.  The regular tape input channel is utilized and decoded to con-
trol the display.
