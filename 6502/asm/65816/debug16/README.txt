This directory is a port of the DEBUG16 program to the Replica 1.

It requires a Replica 1 with a 65816 processor (as far as I know I
have the only one in existence).

It came from the manual "Programming the 65816 Including the 6502,
65C02 and 65802" available from The Western Design Center, Inc.

It provides some code for disassembling and tracing execution on the 65816.

The code needed to be ported to the CC65 assembler and changes made
for input/output on the Replica 1. The original code was intended for
the Apple //e.

There were also a number of typographical as well as logic errors in
the code. At least one other person tried getting this code to work
and noticed the errors. See:

Current status:

Disassembly (LIST) is working. It has not been tested exhaustively for
all instructions.

The trace function has not yet been tested or debugged.
