This is the Rockwell AIM-65 assembler source to be compiled with the ca65 cross assembler.

This work was inspired by the article "AIM Memory Map" published on "MICRO - The 6502/6809 Journal, No. 38 - July 1981".
Many thanks to Greg Paris, the author.

Requires:
 - cc65 cross compiler
 - wget to download original ROMs to compare with
 - enscript and ps2pdf for a nice pdf listing

Description
First I disassembled the assembler ROM with dxa (see disasm directory), then I assigned the remaining labels suggested reading the cited article.
