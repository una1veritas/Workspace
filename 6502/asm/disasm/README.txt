This is a 6502/65C02 disassembler. It supports all 65C02 instructions
including Rockwell and Western Design Center. It is intended to be
assembled with the CC65 cross-assembler. The output is almost
identical to Krusader's disassembler. It can run from RAM or ROM.

A newer version of the code is integrated into my JMON monitor and has
been extended to support the 65816 processor.

The code is licensed under the Apache license so you are free to use
it as you wish under that license.
