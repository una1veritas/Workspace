These are patches for the CC65 assembler/C compiler tools to add
support for the Briel Replica 1 computer. It may also work on a real
Apple 1 or compatible, if the program is small enough or it has
sufficient memory (the original Apple 1 only had 4K of RAM).

The patches apply to the latest version of cc65 and are periodically
updated.

Apply the patch to the cc65 source and then build it as normal or use
the "build" script with suitable changes for your system.

It adds a new target called "replica1". See the files in the example
folder for some examples of how to build and run a C program.
